This paper presents a practical methodology to use neural network for recommending products to users based on their past purchase history.  The model contains three components: a predictor model which is essentially a RNN-style model to capture near-term user interests, a time-decay function which serves as a way to decay the input based on when the purchase happened, and an auto-encoder component which makes sure the user's past purchase history get fully utilized, with the consideration of time decay.  And the paper showed the combination of the three performs the best in terms of precision@K and PCC@K, and also with good scalability.  It also showed good online A/B test performance, which indicates that this approach has been tested in real world. \n\nTwo small concerns:\n1. In Section 3.3. I am not fully sure why the proposed predictor model is able to win over LSTM.  As LSTM tends to mitigate the vanishing gradient problem which most likely would exist in the predictor model.  Some insights might be useful there. \n2. The title of this paper is weird.  Suggest to rephrase \"unreasonable\" to something more positive.[[CLA-NEU],[JUS-NEU],[DEP-NEU],[FAI-NEU],[CON-NEU],[ENG-NEU],[ACC-NEU],[CST-NEU],[NOV-NEU],[ETH-NEU]]
