I am not sure how to interpret this paper.  The paper seems to be very thin technically, unless I missed some important details.  Two proposals in the paper are:\n\n(1) Using a learning rate decay scheme that is fixed relative to the number of epochs used in training,  and \n(2) Extract the penultimate layer output as features to train a conventional classifier such as SVM. \n\nI don't understand why (1) differs from other approaches, in the sense that one cannot simply reduce the number of epochs without hurting performance.  And for (2), it is a relatively standard approach in utilizing CNN features.  Essentially, if I understand correctly, this paper is proposing to prematurely stop training an use the intermediate feature to train a conventional classifier (which is not that away from the softmax classifier that CNNs usually use).  I fail to see how this would lead to superior performance compared to conventional CNNs.[[CLA-POS],[JUS-NEG],[DEP-NEG],[FAI-NEU],[CON-NEU],[ENG-NEU],[ACC-NEU],[CST-NEU],[NOV-NEU],[ETH-NEU]]
