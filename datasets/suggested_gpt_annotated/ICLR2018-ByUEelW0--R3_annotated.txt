Summary: This paper introduces a model that combines the rotation matrices with the LSTMs.  They apply the rotations before the final tanh activation of the LSTM and before applying the output gate.  The rotation matrix is a block-diagonal one where each block is a 2x2 rotations and those rotations are parametrized by another neural network that predicts the angle of the rotations.  The paper only provides results on the bAbI task.  \n\nQuestions:\nHave you compared against to the other parametrizations of the LSTMs and rotation matrices? (ablation study) \nHave you tried on other tasks? \nWhy did you just apply the rotations only on d_{t}. \n\nPros:\nUses a simple parametrization of the rotation matrices. \n\nCons:\nNot clear justification and motivations \nThe experiments are really lacking:\nNo ablation study \nThe results are only limited to single toy task. \n\n\nGeneral Comments:\n\nThis paper proposes to use the rotation matrices with LSTMs.  However there is no clear justification why is this particular parametrization of rotation matrix is being used over others and why is it only applied before the output gate.  The experiments are seriously lacking, an ablation study should have been made and the results are not good enough.  The experiments are only limited to bAbI task which doesn\u2019t tell you much.  This paper is not ready for publication, and really feels like it is rushed. \n\nMinor Comment:\nThis paper needs more proper proof-reading.  There are some typos in it, e.g.:\n1st page, senstence --> sentence\n4th page, the the ..[[CLA-POS],[JUS-NEG],[DEP-POS],[FAI-NEG],[CON-POS],[ENG-POS],[ACC-NEG],[CST-POS],[NOV-NEG],[ETH-NEU]]
