This paper presents a pixel-matching based approach to synthesizing RGB images from input edge or normal maps.  The approach is compared to Isola et al\u2019s conditional adversarial networks, and unlike the conditional GAN, is able to produce a diverse set of outputs. \n\nOverall, the paper describes a computer visions system based on synthesizing images, and not necessarily a new theoretical framework to compete with GANs.  With the current focus of the paper being the proposed system, it is interesting to the computer vision community.  However, if one views the paper in a different light, namely showing some \u201cblind-spots\u201d of current conditional GAN approaches like lack of diversity, then it can be of much more interest to the broader ICLR community. \n\nPros: \nOverall the paper is well-written \nMakes a strong case that random noise injection inside conditional GANs does not produce enough diversity \nShows a number of qualitative and quantitative results \n\nConcerns about the paper:\n1.) It is not clear how well the proposed approach works with CNN architectures other than PixelNet \n2.) Since the paper used \u201cthe pre-trained PixelNet to extract surface normal and edge maps\u201d for ground-truth generation, it is not clear whether the approach will work as well when the input is a ground-truth semantic segmentation map. \n3.) Since the paper describes a computer-vision image synthesis system and not a new theoretical result, I believe reporting the actual run-time of the system will make the paper stronger. \ Can PixelNN run in real-time?  How does the timing compare to Isola et al\u2019s Conditional GAN? \n\nMinor comments:\n1.) The paper mentions making predictions from \u201cincomplete\u201d input several times, but in all experiments, the input is an edge map, normal map, or low-resolution image.  When reading the manuscript the first time, I was expecting experiments on images that have regions that are visible and regions that are masked out.  However, I am not sure if the confusion is solely mine, or shared with other readers. \n\n2.) Equation 1 contains the norm operator twice, and the first norm has no subscript, while the second one has an l_2 subscript.  I would expect the notation style to be consistent within a single equation (i.e., use ||w||_2^2, ||w||^2, or ||w||_{l_2}^2)\n\n3.)  Table 1 has two sub-tables: left and right. The sub-tables have the AP column in different places. \n\n4.) \u201cDense pixel-level correspondences\u201d are discussed but not evaluated.\n[[CLA-POS],[JUS-POS],[DEP-POS],[FAI-NEU],[CON-POS],[ENG-POS],[ACC-POS],[CST-POS],[NOV-POS],[ETH-NEU]]
