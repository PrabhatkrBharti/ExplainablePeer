This paper analyzed the dimensionality of feature maps and fully connected layers of pre-trained CNN on images within a same category.  The local dimensionality of this paper is the SVD dimensionality on the augmented images of the same class images which classified by the neural network as high probability.  However, the motivation of the analysis of this paper is unclear.  I could not understand how such analysis contributes advance of representation learning.  \n\nFurther, the analysis of this paper is not convincing.   \n-      I cannot believe the sum of SVD dimensionality of each feature maps becomes equals to the dimensionality to concatenated feature maps.  As shown in in Fig.8, the estimated dimensions and original dimensions are very different.  Although by looking some features maps, this rule might be hold as shown in Fig.5.  However, the analysis is done on small examples without any theoretical analysis.  \n\n-\tThe authors experimented one trained CNN and tested on images on only three categories (Persian Cat, Container Ship, and Volcao).  It is not clear if the same rules holds to other CNNs, and images of other categories. \n[[CLA-POS],[JUS-NEG],[DEP-NEG],[FAI-NEG],[CON-NEU],[ENG-NEU],[ACC-NEU],[CST-NEU],[NOV-NEU],[ETH-NEU]]
