The paper is mostly a survey about clustering methods with neural networks.  \n\nSection 2 presents a taxonomy for the different neural network clustering methods.  A rich lists of the possible components of the neural network-based clustering methods are given, that include the different neural network architectures, feature to use for clustering, loss functions used and more.  In Section 3, a few methods from the literature are classified according to the proposed taxonomy.  Furthermore, in Section 4 a new method is proposed, that is to combine the best parts of the already existing models in the literature.  Unfortunately, the experiments is Section 5 reveal that the proposed method yields results that are at most comparable with the existing methods.  \n\nThe paper is written well and provides good insights (mostly taxonomy) on the existing methods for neural network-based clustering.  However, the paper lacks novel content.  The novel content of the paper sums up to the proposed method, that is composed of building blocks of existing models, and fails to impress in experimental results.  It could be that this paper belongs to another venue that is more appropriate for survey papers.   Also, it overall rather appears short.\n[[CLA-POS],[JUS-POS],[DEP-POS],[FAI-NEU],[CON-POS],[ENG-POS],[ACC-POS],[CST-NEG],[NOV-NEG],[ETH-NEU]]
