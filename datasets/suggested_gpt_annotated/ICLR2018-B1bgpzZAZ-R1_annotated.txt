This paper gives an elaboration on the Gated Attention Reader (GAR) adding gates based on answer elimination in multiple choice reading comprehension.   I found the formal presentation of the model reasonably clear the the empirical evaluation reasonably compelling. \n\nIn my opinion the main weakness of the paper is the focus on the RACE dataset.   This dataset has not attracted much attention and most work in reading comprehension has now moved to the SQUAD dataset for which there is an active leader board.   I realize that SQUAD is not explicitly multiple choice and that this is a challenge for an answer elimination architecture.   However, it seems that answer elimination might be applied to each choice of the initial position of a possible answer span.   In any case, competing with an active leader board would be much more compelling.[[CLA-POS],[JUS-POS],[DEP-POS],[FAI-NEU],[CON-POS],[ENG-POS],[ACC-POS],[CST-POS],[NOV-NEU],[ETH-NEU]]
