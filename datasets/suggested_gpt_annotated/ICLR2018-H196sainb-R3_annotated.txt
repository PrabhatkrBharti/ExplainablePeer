An unsupervised approach is proposed to build bilingual dictionaries without parallel corpora, by aligning the monolingual word embeddings spaces, i.a. via adversarial learning. \n\nThe paper is very well-written and makes for a rather pleasant read, save for some need for down-toning the claims to novelty as voiced in the comment re: Ravi & Knight (2011) or simply in general:  it's a very nice paper, I enjoy reading it *in spite*, and not *because* of the text sales-pitching itself at times .\n\nThere are some gaps in the awareness of the related work in the sub-field of bilingual lexicon induction, e.g. the work by Vulic & Moens (2016).\ n\nThe evaluation is for the most part intrinsic, and it would be nice to see the approach applied downstream beyond the simplistic task of English-Esperanto translation: plenty of outlets out there for applying multilingual word embeddings.  Would be nice to see at least some instead of the plethora of intrinsic evaluations of limited general interest. \n\nIn my view, to conclude, this is still a very nice paper, so I vote clear accept, in hope to see these minor flaws filtered out in the revision.[[CLA-POS],[JUS-POS],[DEP-POS],[FAI-NEU],[CON-NEU],[ENG-NEU],[ACC-NEU],[CST-NEU],[NOV-NEU],[ETH-NEU]]
