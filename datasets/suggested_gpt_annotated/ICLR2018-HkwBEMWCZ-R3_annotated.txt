This paper proposes to explain the benefits of skip connections in terms of eliminating the singularities of the loss function.  The discussion is largely based on a sequence of experiments, some of which are interesting and insightful.  The discussion here can be useful for other researchers.  \n\nMy main concern is that the result here is purely empirical, with no concrete theoretical justification.  What the experiments reveal is an empirical correlation between the Eigval index and training accuracy, which can be caused by lots of reasons (and cofounders), and does not necessarily establish a causal relation.  Therefore, i found many of the discussion to be questionable.  I would love to see more solid theoretical discussion to justify the hypothesis proposed in this paper. \n \nDo you have a sense how accurate is the estimation of the tail probabilities of the eigenvalues?  Because the whole paper is based on the approximation of the eigval indexes, it is critical to exam the estimation is accurate enough to draw the conclusions in the paper.  \n\nAll the conclusions are based on one or two datasets.  Could you consider testing the result on more different datasets to verify if the results are generalizable?
