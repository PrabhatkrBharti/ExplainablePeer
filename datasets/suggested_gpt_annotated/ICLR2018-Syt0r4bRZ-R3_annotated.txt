This paper presents a model to encode and decode trees in distributed representations.  \nThis is not the first attempt of doing these encoders and decoders.  However, there is not a comparative evalution with these methods. \nIn fact, it has been demonstrated that it is possible to encode and decode trees in distributed structures without learning parameters, see \"Decoding Distributed Tree Structures\" and \"Distributed tree kernels\". \nThe paper should present a comparison with such kinds of models.\n[[CLA-POS],[JUS-POS],[DEP-POS],[FAI-NEU],[CON-NEU],[ENG-NEU],[ACC-NEU],[CST-NEU],[NOV-NEU],[ETH-NEU]]
