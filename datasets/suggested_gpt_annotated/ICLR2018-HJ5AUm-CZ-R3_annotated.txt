The paper presents some conceptually incremental improvements over the models in \u201cNeural Statistician\u201d and \u201cGenerative matching networks\u201d.  Nevertheless, it is well written and I think it is solid work with reasonable convincing experiments and good results.  Although, the authors use powerful PixelCNN priors and decoders and they do not really disentangle to what degree their good results rely on the capabilities of these autoregressive components.[[CLA-POS],[JUS-POS],[DEP-POS],[FAI-NEU],[CON-NEU],[ENG-NEU],[ACC-NEU],[CST-NEU],[NOV-NEU],[ETH-NEU]]
