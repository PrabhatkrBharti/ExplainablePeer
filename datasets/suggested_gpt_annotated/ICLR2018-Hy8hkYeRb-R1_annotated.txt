Quality\n\nThe authors introduce a deep network for predictive coding.  It is unclear how the approach improves on the original predictive coding formulation of Rao and Ballard, who also use a hierarchy of transformations.  The results seem to indicate that all layers are basically performing the same.  No insight is provided about the kinds of filters that are learned. n\nClarity\n\nIn its present form it is hard to assess if there are benefits to the current formulation compared to already existing formulations. . The paper should be checked for typos. \n\nOriginality\n\nThere exist alternative deep predictive coding models such as https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.08104.  This work should be discussed and compared. \n\nSignificance \n\nIt is hard to see how the present paper improves on classical or alternative (deep) predictive coding results. \n\nPros\n\nRelevant attempt to develop new predictive coding architectures \n\nCons\n\nUnclear what is gained compared to existing work.[[CLA-POS],[JUS-NEG],[DEP-NEG],[FAI-NEU],[CON-NEU],[ENG-NEU],[ACC-NEU],[CST-NEU],[NOV-NEU],[ETH-NEU]]
