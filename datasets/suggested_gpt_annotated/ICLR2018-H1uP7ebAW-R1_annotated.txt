The paper proposes to combine the recently proposed DenseNet architecture with LSTMs to tackle the problem of predicting different pathologic patterns from chest x-rays.  In particular, the use of LSTMs helps take into account interdependencies between pattern labels.  \n\nStrengths:\n- The paper is very well written.  Contextualization with respect to previous work is adequate.  Explanations are clear.  Novelties are clearly identified by the authors. \n- Quantitative improvement with respect to the state the art.  \n\nWeaknesses:\n- The paper does not introduce strong technical novelties -- mostly, it seems to apply previous techniques to the medical domain.  It could have been interesting to know if there are more insights / lessons learned in this process.  This could be of interest for a broader audience.  For instance, what are the implications of using higher-resolution images as input to DenseNet / decreasing the number of layers?  How do the features learned at different layers compare to the ones of the original network trained for image classification?  How do features of networks pre-trained on ImageNet, and then fine-tuned for the medical domain, compare to features learned from medical images from scratch?  \n- The impact of the proposed approach on medical diagnostics is unclear.  The authors could better discuss how the approach could be adopted in practice.  Also, it could be interesting also to discuss how the results in Table 2 and 3 compare to human classification capabilities, and if that performance would be already enough for building a computer-aided diagnosis system. \n\nFinally -- is it expected that the ordering of the factorization in Eq. 3 does not count much (results in Table 3)?  As a non-expert in the field, I'd expect that ordering between pathologic patterns matters more.[[CLA-POS],[JUS-POS],[DEP-POS],[FAI-NEU],[CON-POS],[ENG-POS],[ACC-POS],[CST-POS],[NOV-NEG],[ETH-NEU]]
