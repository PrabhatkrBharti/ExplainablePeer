Quality\n\nThis is a very clear contribution which elegantly demonstrates the use of extensions of GAN variants in the context of neuroimaging. \n\nClarity\n\nThe paper is well-written.  Methods and results are clearly described.  The authors state significant improvements in classification using generated data.  These claims should be substantiated with significance tests comparing classification on standard versus augmented datasets. \n\nOriginality\n\nThis is one of the first uses of GANs in the context of neuroimaging."  \n\nSignificance \n\nThe approach outlined in this paper may spawn a new research direction. \n\nPros\n\nWell-written and original contribution demonstrating the use of GANs in the context of neuroimaging. \n\nCons\n\nThe focus on neuroimaging might be less relevant to the broader AI community[[CLA-POS],[JUS-POS],[DEP-POS],[FAI-NEU],[CON-POS],[ENG-POS],[ACC-POS],[CST-POS],[NOV-POS],[ETH-NEU]]
