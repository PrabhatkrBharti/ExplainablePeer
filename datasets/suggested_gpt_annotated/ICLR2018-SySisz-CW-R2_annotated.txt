This work exploits the causality principle to quantify how the weights of successive layers adapt to each other.   Some interesting results are obtained, such as \"enforcing more independence between successive layers of generators may lead to better performance and modularity of these architectures\" .  Generally, the result is interesting and the presentation is easy to follow.  However, the proposed approach and the experiments are not convincible enough.   For example,  it is hard to obtain the conclusion \"more independence lead to better performance\" from the experimental results.  Maybe more justifications are needed.[[CLA-POS],[JUS-NEG],[DEP-POS],[FAI-NEU],[CON-NEU],[ENG-NEU],[ACC-NEU],[CST-NEU],[NOV-NEU],[ETH-NEU]]
