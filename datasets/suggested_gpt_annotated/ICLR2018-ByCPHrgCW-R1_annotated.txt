This paper proposes a hybrid Homomorphic encryption system that is well suited for privacy-sensitive data inference applications with the deep learning paradigm.  \nThe paper presents a well laid research methodology that shows a good decomposition of the problem at hand and the approach foreseen to solve it.  It is well reflected in the paper and most importantly the rationale for the implementation decisions taken is always clear. \n\nThe results obtained (as compared to FHEW) seem to indicate well thought off decisions taken to optimize the different gates' operations as clearly explained in the paper.  For example, reducing bootstrapping operations by two-complementing both the plaintext and the ciphertext, whenever the number of 1s in the plain bit-string is greater than the number of 0s (3.4/Page 6). \n\nResult interpretation is coherent with the approach and data used and shows a good understanding of the implications of the implementation  decisions made in the system and the data sets used. \nOverall, fine work, well organized, decomposed, and its rationale clearly explained.  The good results obtained support the design decisions made. \nOur main concern is regarding thorough comparison to similar work and provision of comparative work assessment to support novelty claims. \n\nNota: \n     - In Figure 4/Page 4: AND Table A(1)/B(0), shouldn't  A And B be 0? \n     - Unlike Figure 3/Page 3, in Figure 2/page 2, shouldn't  operations' precedence prevail (No brackets), therefore 1+2*2=5[[CLA-POS],[JUS-POS],[DEP-POS],[FAI-NEU],[CON-POS],[ENG-POS],[ACC-POS],[CST-NEG],[NOV-NEG],[ETH-NEU]]
