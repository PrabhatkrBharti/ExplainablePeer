This work presents a CNN training setup that uses half precision implementation that can get 2X speedup for training.  The work is clearly presented and the evaluations seem convincing.  The presented implementations are competitive in terms of accuracy, when compared to the FP32 representation.   I'm not an expert in this area but the contribution seems relevant to me, and enough for being published.[[CLA-POS],[JUS-POS],[DEP-NEU],[FAI-NEU],[CON-NEU],[ENG-NEU],[ACC-NEU],[CST-NEU],[NOV-NEU],[ETH-NEU]]
