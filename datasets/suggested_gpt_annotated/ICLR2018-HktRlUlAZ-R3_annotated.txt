The authors introduce the Polar Transformer, a special case of the Spatial Transformer (Jaderberg et al. 2015) that achieves rotation and scale equivariance by using a log-polar sampling grid.  The paper is very well written, easy to follow and substantiates its claims convincingly on variants of MNIST.  A weakness of the paper is that it does not attempt to solve a real-world problem.  However, I think because it is a conceptually novel and potentially very influential idea, it is a valuable contribution as it stands. \n\nIssues:\n\n- The clutter in SIM2MNIST is so small that predicting the polar origin is essentially trivially solved by a low-pass filter.  Although this criticism also applies to most previous work using \u2018cluttered\u2019 variants of MNIST, I still think it needs to be considered.  What happens if predicting the polar origin is not trivial and prone to errors?  These presumably lead to catastrophic failure of the post-transformer network, which is likely to be a problem in any real-world scenario. \n\n- I\u2019m not sure if Section 5.5 strengthens the paper.  Unlike the rest of the paper, it feels very \u2018quick & dirty\u2019 and not very principled.  It doesn\u2019t live up to the promise of rotation and scale equivariance in 3D.  If I understand it correctly, it\u2019s simply a polar transformer in (x,y) with z maintained as a linear axis and assumed to be parallel to the axis of rotation.  This means that the promise of rotation and scale equivariance holds up only along (x,y).  I guess it\u2019s not possible to build full 3D rotation/scale equivariance with the authors\u2019 approach (spherical coordinates probably don\u2019t do the job), but at least the scale equivariance could presumably have been achieved by using log-spaced samples along z and predicting the origin in 3D.  So instead of showing a quick \u2018hack\u2019, I would have preferred an honest discussion of the limitations and maybe a sketch of a path forward even if no implemented solution is provided.\n[[CLA-POS],[JUS-POS],[DEP-POS],[FAI-NEU],[CON-POS],[ENG-POS],[ACC-POS],[CST-POS],[NOV-POS],[ETH-NEU]]
