The paper proposes new RNN training method based on the SEARN learning to search (L2S) algorithm and named as SeaRnn.  It proposes a way of overcoming the limitation of local optimization trough the exploitation of the structured losses by L2S.  It can consider different classifiers and loss functions, and a sampling strategy for making the optimization problem scalable is proposed.  SeaRnn improves the results obtained by MLE training in three different problems, including a large-vocabulary machine translation.  In summary, a very nice paper. \n\nQuality: SeaRnn is a well rooted and successful application of the L2S strategy to the RNN training that combines at the same time global optimization and scalable complexity.  \n\nClarity: The paper is well structured and written, with a nice and well-founded literature review. \n\nOriginality: the paper presents a new algorithm for training RNN based on the L2S methodology, and it has been proven to be competitive in both toy and real-world problems. \n\nSignificance: although the application of L2S to RNN training is not new[[CLA-POS],[JUS-POS],[DEP-POS],[FAI-NEU],[CON-NEU],[ENG-POS],[ACC-POS],[CST-POS],[NOV-POS],[ETH-NEU]]
