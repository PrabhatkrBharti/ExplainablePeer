\nI thank the authors for the thoughtful response and updated manuscript.  After reading through both, my review score remains unchanged. \n\n=================\n\nThe authors describe a new variant of a generative adversarial network (GAN) for generating images.  This model employs a 'projection discriminator' in order to incorporate image labels and demonstrate that the resulting model outperforms state-of-the-art GAN models. \n\nMajor comments:\n1) Spatial resolution. What spatial resolution is the model generating images at?  The AC-GAN work performed an analysis to assess how information is being introduced at each spatial resolution by assessing the gains in the Inception score versus naively resizing the image.  It is not clear how much the gains of this model is due to generating better lower resolution images and performing simple upscaling.  It would be great to see the authors address this issue in a serious manner. \n\n2) FID in real data. The numbers in Table 1 appear favorable to the projection model.  Please add error bars (based on Figure 4, I would imagine they are quite large).  Additionally, would it be possible to compute this statistic for *real* images?  I would be curious to know what the FID looks like as a 'gold standard'. \n\n3) Conditional batch normalization.  I am not clear how much of the gains arose from employing conditional batch normalization versus the proposed method for incorporating the projection based discriminator.  The former has been seen to be quite powerful in accomodating multi-modal tasks (e.g. https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.07871, https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.07629\n).  If the authors could provide some evidence highlighting the marginal gains of one technique, that would be extremely helpful. \n\nMinor comments:\n- I believe you have the incorrect reference for conditional batch normalization on Page 5. \nA Learned Representation For Artistic Style \nDumoulin, Shlens and Kudlur (2017)\nhttps://arxiv.org/abs/1610.07629 \n\n- Please enlarge images in Figure 5-8. Hard to see the detail of 128x128 images. \n\n- Please add citations for Figures 1a-1b.  Do these correspond with some known models? \n\nDepending on how the authors respond to the reviews, I would consider upgrading the score of my review.[[CLA-POS],[JUS-POS],[DEP-POS],[FAI-NEU],[CON-POS],[ENG-POS],[ACC-POS],[CST-POS],[NOV-POS],[ETH-NEU]]
