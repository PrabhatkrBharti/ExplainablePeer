Overall, the idea of this paper is simple but interesting.  Via performing variational inference in a kind of online manner, one can address continual learning for deep discriminative or generative networks with considerations of model uncertainty. \n\nThe paper is written well,  and literature review is sufficient.  My comment is mainly about its importance for large-scale computer vision applications.  The neural networks in the experiments are shallow. \n[[CLA-POS],[JUS-POS],[DEP-NEU],[FAI-NEU],[CON-NEU],[ENG-NEU],[ACC-NEU],[CST-NEU],[NOV-NEU],[ETH-NEU]]
