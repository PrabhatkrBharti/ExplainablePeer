This paper proposed a probabilistic framework for domain adaptation that properly explains why maximizing both the marginal and the conditional log-likelihoods can achieve desirable performances.   \nHowever, I have the following concerns on novelty.  \n\n1. Although the paper gives some justiification why auto-encoder can work for domain adaptation from perspective of probalistics model, it does not give new formulation or algorithm to handle domain adaptation.   At this point, the novelty is weaken. \n2. In the introduction, the authors mentioned \u201climitations of mSDA is that it needs to explicitly form the covariance matrix of input features and then solves a linear system, which can be computationally expensive in high dimensional settings. \u201d However, mSDA cannot handle high dimension setting by performing the  reconstruction with a number of  random non-overlapping sub-sets of input features.  It is not clear why mSDA cannot handle time-series data but DAuto can.   DAuto does not consider the sequence/ordering of data either.  \n3. If my understanding is not wrong, the proposed DAuto is just a simple combination of three losses (i.e. prediction loss, reconstruction loss, domain difference loss).  As far as I know, this kind of loss is commonly used in most existing methods. [[CLA-POS],[JUS-POS],[DEP-POS],[FAI-NEU],[CON-NEU],[ENG-NEU],[ACC-NEU],[CST-NEU],[NOV-NEU],[ETH-NEU]]
