my main concern is the relevance of this paper to ICLR. \nThis paper is much related not to representation learning but to user-interface. \nThe paper is NOT well organized and so the technical novelty of the method is unclear. \nFor example, the existing method and proposed method seems to be mixed in Section 2. \nYou should clearly divide the existing study and your work.  \nThe experimental setting is also unclear. \nKSS seems to need the user study. \nBut I do not catch the details of the user study, e.g., the number of users[[CLA-NEG],[JUS-NEG],[DEP-NEG],[FAI-NEU],[CON-NEG],[ENG-NEG],[ACC-NEG],[CST-NEG],[NOV-NEG],[ETH-NEU]]
