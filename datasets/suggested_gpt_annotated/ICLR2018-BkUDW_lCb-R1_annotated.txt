The paper claims to develop a novel method to map natural language queries to SQL.  They claim to have the following contributions: \n\n1. Using a grammar to guide decoding  \n2. Using a new loss function for pointer / copy mechanism.  For each output token, they aggregate scores for all positions that the output token can be copied from. \n\nI am confident that point 1 has been used in several previous works.  Although point 2 seems novel, I am not convinced that it is significant enough for ICLR.  I was also not sure why there is a need to copy items from the input question, since all SQL query nouns will be present in the SQL table in some form.   What will happen if we restrict the copy mechanism to only copy from SQL table. \n\nThe references need work. There are repeated entries for the same reference (one form arxiv and one from conference).  Please cite the conference version if one is available, many arxiv references have conference versions. \n\nRebuttal Response: I am still not confident about the significance of contribution 1, so keeping the score the same.[[CLA-POS],[JUS-POS],[DEP-POS],[FAI-NEU],[CON-NEU],[ENG-NEU],[ACC-NEU],[CST-NEU],[NOV-NEU],[ETH-NEU]]
