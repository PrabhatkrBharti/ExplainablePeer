In the paper, the authors discuss several GAN evaluation metrics. \nSpecifically, the authors pointed out some desirable properties that GANS evaluation metrics should satisfy. \nFor those properties raised, the authors experimentally evaluated whether existing metrics satisfy those properties or not. \nSection 4 summarizes the results, which concluded that the Kernel MMD and 1-NN classifier in the feature space are so far recommended metrics to be used. \n\nI think this paper tackles an interesting and important problem, what metrics are preferred for evaluating GANs. \nIn particular, the authors showed that Inception Score, which is one of the most popular metric, is actually not preferred for several reasons. \nThe result, comparing data distributions and the distribution of the generator would be the preferred choice (that can be attained by Kernel MMD and 1-NN classifier), seems to be reasonable. \nThis would not be a surprising result as the ultimate goal of GAN is mimicking the data distribution. \nHowever, the result is supported by exhaustive experiments making the result highly convincing. \n\nOverall, I think this paper is worthy for acceptance as several GAN methods are proposed and good evaluation metrics are needed for further improvements of the research field.\n[[CLA-POS],[JUS-POS],[DEP-POS],[FAI-NEU],[CON-POS],[ENG-POS],[ACC-POS],[CST-POS],[NOV-POS],[ETH-NEU]]
