This paper proposed a framework to connect the solving of GAN with finding the saddle point of a minimax problem. \nAs a result, the primal-dual subgradient methods can be directly introduced to calculate the saddle point. \nAdditionally, this idea not only fill the relatviely lacking of theoretical results for GAN or WGAN, but also provide a new perspective to modify the GAN-type models. \nBut this saddle point model reformulation  in section 2 is quite standard, with limited theoretical analysis in Theorem 1. \nAs follows, the resulting algorithm 1 is also standard primal-dual method for a saddle point problem. \nMost important I think, the advantage of considering GAN-type model as a saddle point model is that first--order methods can be designed to solve it.  But the numerical experiments part seems to be a bit weak, because the MINST or CIFAR-10 dataset is not large enough to test the extensibility for large-scale cases.
