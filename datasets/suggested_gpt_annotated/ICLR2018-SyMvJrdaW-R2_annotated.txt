Paper proposes a shallow model for approximating stacks of Resnet layers, based on mathematical approximations to the Resnet equations and experimental insights, and uses this technique to train Resnet-like models in half the time on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100.  While the experiments are not particularly impressive,  I liked the originality of this paper. [[CLA-POS],[JUS-POS],[DEP-NEU],[FAI-NEU],[CON-NEU],[ENG-NEU],[ACC-NEU],[CST-NEU],[NOV-NEU],[ETH-NEU]]
