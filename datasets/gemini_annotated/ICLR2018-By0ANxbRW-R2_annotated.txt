The paper addresses an interesting problem of DNN model compression.  The main idea is to combine the approaches in (Han et al., 2015) and (Ullrich et al., 2017) to get a loss value constrained k-means encoding method for network compression.  An iterative algorithm is developed for model optimization.  Experimental results on MNIST, CIFAR-10 and SVHN are reported to show the compression performance.  \n\nThe reviewer would expect papers submitted for review to be of publishable quality.  However, this manuscript is not polished enough for publication: it has too many language errors and imprecisions which make the paper hard to follow.  In particular, there is no clear definition of problem formulation, and the algorithms are poorly presented and elaborated in the context.  \n\nPros: \n\n- The network compression problem is of general interest to ICLR audience.  \n\nCons:\n\n- The proposed approach follows largely the existing work and thus its technical novelty is weak.  \n\n- Paper presentation quality is clearly below the standard.  \n\n- Empirical results do not clearly show the advantage of the proposed method over state-of-the-arts[[CLA-NEG],[JUS-NEG],[DEP-POS],[FAI-POS],[CON-POS],[ENG-POS],[ACC-POS],[CST-POS],[NOV-POS],[ETH-NEG]]
