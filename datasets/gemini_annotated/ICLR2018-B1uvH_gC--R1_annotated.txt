The paper describes a manifold learning method that adapts the old ideas of multidimensional scaling, with geodesic distances in particular, to neural networks.  The goal is to switch from a non-parametric to a parametric method and hence to have a straightforward out-of-sample extension. \n\nThe paper has several major shortcomings:\n* Any paper dealing with MDS and geodesic distances should test the proposed method on the Swiss roll, which has been the most emblematic benchmark since the Isomap paper in 2000.  Not showing the Swiss roll would possibly let the reader think that the method does not perform well on that example.  In particular, DR is one of the last fields where deep learning cannot outperform older methods like t-SNE.  Please add the Swiss roll example. \n* Distance preservation appears more and more like a dated DR paradigm.  Simple example from 3D to 2D are easily handled but beyond the curse of dimensionality makes things more complicated, in particular due to norm computation.  Computation accuracy of the geodesic distances in high-dimensional spaces can be poor.  This could be discussed and some experiments on very HD data should be reported. \n* Some key historical references are overlooked, like the SAMMANN.  There is also an over-emphasis on spectral methods, with the necessity to compute large matrices and to factorize them, probably owing to the popularity of spectral DR metods a decade ago.  Other methods might be computationally less expensive, like those relying on space-partitioning trees and fast multipole methods (subquadratic complexity).  Finally, auto-encoders could be mentioned as well; they have the advantage of providing the parametric inverse of the mapping too. \n* As a tool for unsupervised learning or exploratory data visualization, DR can hardly benefit from a parametric approach.  The motivation in the end of page 3 seems to be computational only. \n* Section 3 should be further detailed (step 2 in particular). \n* The experiments are rather limited, with only a few artifcial data sets and hardly any quantitative assessment except for some monitoring of the stress.  The running times are not in favor of the proposed method.  The data sets sizes are, however, quite limited, with N<10000 for point cloud data and N<2000 for the image manifold. \n* The conclusion sounds a bit vague and pompous ('by allowing a limited infusion of axiomatic computation...').
