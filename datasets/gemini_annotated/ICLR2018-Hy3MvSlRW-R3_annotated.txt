The main idea of this paper is to automate the construction of adversarial reading comprehension problems in the spirit of Jia and Liang, EMNLP 2017.   In that work a \"distractor sentence\" is manually added to a passage to superficially, but not logically, support an incorrect answer.   It was shown that these distractor sentences largely fool existing reading comprehension systems although they do not fool human readers.  \n\nThis paper replaces the manual addition of a distractor sentence with a single word replacement where a \"narrator\" is trained adversarially to select a replacement to fool the question answering system.    This idea seems interesting but very difficult to evaluate.    An adversarial word replacement my in fact destroy the factual information needed to answer the question and there is no control for this.    The performance of the question answering system in the presence of this adversarial narrator is of unclear significance and the empirical results in the paper are very difficult to interpret.    No comparisons with previous work are given (and perhaps cannot be given).  \n\nA better model would be the addition of a distractor sentence as this preserves the information in the original passage.    A language model could probably be used to generate a compelling distractor.    But we want that the corrupted passage has the same correct answer as the uncorrupted passage and this difficult to guarantee.    A trained \"narrator\" could learn to actually change the correct answer.[[CLA-POS],[JUS-POS],[DEP-POS],[FAI-POS],[CON-POS],[ENG-NEG],[ACC-POS],[CST-POS],[NOV-POS],[ETH-NEG]]
