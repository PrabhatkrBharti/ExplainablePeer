The authors revised the paper according to all reviewers suggestions, I am satisfied with the current version. \n\nSummary: this works proposes to employ recurrent gated convnets to solve graph node labeling problems on arbitrary graphs.  It build upon several previous works, successively introducing convolutional networks, gated edges convnets on graphs, and LSTMs on trees.  The authors extend the tree LSTMs formulation to perform graph labeling on arbitrary graphs, merge convnets with residual connections and edge gating mechanisms.  They apply the 2 proposed models to 3 baselines also based on graph neural networks on two problems: sub-graph matching (expressing the problem of sub-graph matching as a node classification problem), and semi supervised clustering.   \n\nMain comments:\nIt would strengthen the paper to also compare all these network learning based approaches to variational ones.  For instance, to a spectral clustering method for the semi supervised clustering, or\nsolving the combinatorial Dirichlet problem as in Grady: random walks for image segmentation, 2006. \n\nThe abstract and the conclusion should be revised, they are very vague. \n- The abstract should be self contained and should not contain citations. \n- The authors should clarify which problem they are dealing with. \n- instead of the \"numerical result show the performance of the new model\", give some numerical results here, otherwise, this sentence is useless. \n- we propose ... as propose -> unclear: what do you propose? \n \n\nMinor comments:\n- You should make sentences when using references with the author names format.  Example: ... graph theory, Chung (1997) -> graph theory by Chung (1997) \n- As Eq 2 -> As the minimization of Eq 2 (same with eq 4)\n- Don't start sentences with And, or But\n\n[[CLA-POS],[JUS-POS],[DEP-POS],[FAI-POS],[CON-POS],[ENG-POS],[ACC-POS],[CST-POS],[NOV-POS],[ETH-NEG]]
