This paper introduces a fairly elaborate model for reading comprehension evaluated on the SQuAD dataset.    The model is shown to improve on the published results but not as-of-submission leaderboard numbers. \n\nThe main weakness of the paper in my opinion is that the innovations seem to be incremental and not based on any overarching insight or general principle.   A less significant issue is that the English is often disfluent. \n\nSpecific comments: I would remove the significance daggers from table 2 as the standard deviations are already reported and the null hypothesis for which significance is measured seems unclear.   I am also concerned to see test performance significantly better than development performance in table 3.   Other systems seem to have development and test performance closer together.   Have the authors been evaluating many times on the test data[[CLA-POS],[JUS-POS],[DEP-POS],[FAI-POS],[CON-POS],[ENG-NEG],[ACC-NEG],[CST-POS],[NOV-NEG],[ETH-NEG]]
