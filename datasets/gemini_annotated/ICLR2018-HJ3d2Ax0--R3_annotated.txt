The paper proposes to use the start-end rank to measure the long-term dependency in RNNs.  It shows that deep RNN is signficantly better than shallow one in this metric.  \n\nThe theory part seems to be technical enough and interesting,  though I haven't checked all the details . The main concern with the paper is that I am not sure whether the RAC studied by the paper is realistic enough for practice.  Certain gating in RNN is very useful but I don't know whether one can train any reasonable RNN with all multiplicative gates . The paper will be much stronger if it has some experiments along this line. [[CLA-POS],[JUS-POS],[DEP-POS],[FAI-POS],[CON-POS],[ENG-NEG],[ACC-POS],[CST-POS],[NOV-NEG],[ETH-NEG]]
