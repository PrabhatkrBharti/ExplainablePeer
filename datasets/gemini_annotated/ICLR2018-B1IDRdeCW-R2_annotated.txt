This paper presents three observations to understand binary network in Courbariaux, Hubara et al. (2016).  My main concerns are on the usage of the given observations.  \n\n1. Can the observations be used to explain more recent works? \n\nIndeed, Courbariaux, Hubara et al. (2016) is a good and pioneered work on the binary network.  However, as the authors mentioned, there are more recent works which give better performance than this one.  For example, we can use +1, 0, -1 to approximate the weights.  Besides, [a] has also shown a carefully designed post-processing binary network can already give very good performance.  So, how can the given observations be used to explain more recent works? \n\n2. How can the given observations be used to improve Courbariaux, Hubara et al. (2016)? \n\nThe authors call their findings theory.  From this perspective, I wish to see more mathematical analysis rather than just doing experiments and showing some interesting observations.  Besides, giving interesting observations is not good enough.  I wish to see how they can be used to improve binary networks. \n\nReference\n[a].
