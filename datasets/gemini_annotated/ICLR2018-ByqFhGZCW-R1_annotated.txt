The game-theoretic approach to attacks with / defense against adversarial examples is an important direction of the security of deep learning and I appreciate the authors to initiate this kind of study.  \n\nLemma 1 summarizes properties of the solutions that are expected to have after reaching equilibria.  Important properties of saddle points in the min-max/max-min analysis assume that the function is convex/concave w.r.t. to the target variable.   In case of deep learning, the convexity is not guaranteed and the resulting solutions do not have necessarily follow Lemma 1. \u3000Nonetheless, this type of analysis can be useful under appropriate solutions if non-trivial claims are derived; however, Lemma 1 simply explains basic properties of the min-max solutions and max-min solutions works and does not contain non-tibial claims. \n\nAs long as the analysis is experimental, the state of the art should be considered.  As long as the reviewer knows, the CW attack gives the most powerful attack and this should be considered for comparison. The results with MNIST and CIFAR-10 are different.  In some cases, MNIST is too easy to consider the complex structure of deep architectures.  I prefer to have discussions on experimental results with both datasets. \n\nThe main takeaway from the entire paper is not clear very much.  It contains a game-theoretic framework of adversarial examples/training, novel attack method, and many experimental results. \n\nMinor:\nDefinition of g in the beginning of Sec 3.1 seems to be a typo.  What is u? This is revealed in the latter sections but should be specified here. \n\nIn Section 3.1, \n>This is in stark contrast with the near-perfect misclassification of the undefended classifier in Table 1. \nThe results shown in the table seems to indicate the \u201cperfect\u201d misclassification. \n\nSentence after eq. 15 seems to contain a grammatical error. \n\nThe paragraph after eq. 17 is duplicated with a paragraph introduced before[[CLA-POS],[JUS-POS],[DEP-POS],[FAI-POS],[CON-POS],[ENG-POS],[ACC-POS],[CST-POS],[NOV-NEG],[ETH-NEG]]
