The paper studies a combination of model-based and model-free RL.  The idea is to train a forward predictive model which provides multi-step estimates to facilitate model-free policy learning.   Some parts of the paper lack clarity and the empirical results need improvement to support the claims (see details below).    \n\nClarity \n- The main idea of the proposed method is clear.  \n- Some notations and equations are broken.  For example: \n(1) The definition of \\bar{A} in Section 4 is broken.  \n(2) The overall objective in Section 5 is broken.  \n(3) The computation of w in Algorithm 2 is problematic.  \n- Some details of the experiments/methods are confusing.  For example: \n(1) The step number k is dynamically determined by a short line search as in Section 4 ``Dynamic Rollout\u2019\u2019, but later in the experiments (Section 6) the value of k is set to be 2 uniformly.  \n(2) Only the policy and value networks specified.  The forward models are not specified.   \n(3) In algorithm 1, what exact method is used in determining if \\mu is converged or not?  \n\nOriginality\nThe proposed method can be viewed as a multi-step version of the stochastic value gradient algorithm.  An empirical comparison could be helpful but not provided.  \n\nThe idea of the proposed method is related to the classic Dyna methods from Sutton.  A discussion on the difference would be helpful.  \n\nSignificance\n- The paper could compare against other relevant baselines that combine model-based and model-free RL methods, such as SVG (stochastic value gradient).  \n- To make a fair comparison, the results in Table 1 should consider the amount of data used in pre-training the forward models.  Current results in Table 1 only compare the amount of data in policy learning.   \n- Figure 3 is plotted for just one random starting state.  The Figure could have been more informative if it was averaged over different starting states.   The same issue is found in Figure 2.   It would be helpful if the plots of other domains are provided.  \n- In Figure 2, even though the diff norm fluctuates, the cosine similarity remains almost constant.  Does it suggest the cosine similarity is not effective in measuring the state similarity?  \n- Figure 1, 4 and 5 need confidence intervals or standard errors.  \n\nPros:\n- The research direction in combining model-based and model-free RL is interesting. \n- The main idea of the proposed method is clear.  \n\nCons:\n- Parts of the paper are unclear and some details are missing.  \n- The paper needs more discussion and comparison to relevant baseline methods.   \n- The empirical results need improvement to support the paper\u2019s claims[[CLA-NEG],[JUS-NEG],[DEP-NEG],[FAI-NEG],[CON-NEG],[ENG-NEG],[ACC-NEG],[CST-NEG],[NOV-NEG],[ETH-NEG]]
