The paper introduces SVD parameterization and uses it mostly for controlling the spectral norm of the RNN.  \n\nMy concerns with the paper include: \n\na) the paper says that the same method works for convolutional neural networks but I couldn't find anything about convolution.  \n\nb) the theoretical analysis might be misleading --- clearly section 6.2 shouldn't have title ALL CRITICAL POINTS ARE GLOBAL MINIMUM because 0 is a critical point but it's not a global minimum.  Theorem 5 should be phrased as \n\nall critical points of the population risk that is non-singular are global minima. \n\nc) the paper should run some experiments on language applications where RNN is widely used \n\nd) I might be wrong on this point, but it seems that the GPU utilization of the method would be very poor so that it's kind of impossible to scale to large datasets? \n[[CLA-NEG],[JUS-NEG],[DEP-NEG],[FAI-NEG],[CON-NEG],[ENG-NEG],[ACC-NEG],[CST-NEG],[NOV-NEG],[ETH-NEG]]
