The paper presents an interesting spectral algorithm for multiscale hmm . The derivation and analysis seems correct.  However, it is well-known that spectral algorithm is not robust to model mis-specification.  It is not clear whether the proposed algorithm will be useful in practice.  How will the method compare to EM algorithms and neural network based approaches?[[CLA-POS],[JUS-POS],[DEP-POS],[FAI-POS],[CON-POS],[ENG-POS],[ACC-POS],[CST-POS],[NOV-POS],[ETH-NEG]]
