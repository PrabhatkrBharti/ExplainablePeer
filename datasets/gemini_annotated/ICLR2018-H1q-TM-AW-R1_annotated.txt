This paper presents two complementary models for unsupervised domain adaptation (classification task): 1) the Virtual Adversarial Domain Adaptation (VADA) and 2) the Decision-boundary Iterative Refinement Training with a Teacher (DIRT-T).  The authors make use of the so-called cluster assumption, i.e., decision boundaries should not cross high-density data regions.  VADA extends the standard Domain-Adversarial training by introducing an additional objective L_t that measures the target-side cluster assumption violation, namely, the conditional entropy w.r.t. the target distribution.  Since the empirical estimate of the conditional entropy breaks down for non-locally-Lipschitz classifiers, the authors also propose to incorporate virtual adversarial training in order to make the classifier well-behaved.  The paper also argues that the performance on the target domain can be further improved by a post-hoc minimization of L_t using natural gradient descent (DIRT-T) which ensures that the decision boundary changes incrementally and slowly.     \n\nPros:\n+ The paper is written clearly and easy to read \n+ The idea to keep the decision boundary in the low-density region of the target domain makes sense \n+ The both proposed methods seem to be quite easy to implement and incorporate into existing DATNN-based frameworks \n+ The combination of VADA and DIRT-T performs better than existing DA algorithms on a range of visual DA benchmarks \n\nCons:\n- Table 1 can be a bit misleading as the performance improvements may be partially attributed to the fact that different methods employ different base NN architectures and different optimizers \n- The paper deals exclusively with visual domains; applying the proposed methods to other modalities would make this submission stronger \n\nOverall, I think it is a good paper and deserves to be accepted to the conference.  I\u2019m especially appealed by the fact that the ideas presented in this work, despite being simple, demonstrate excellent performance. \n\nPost-rebuttal revision:\nAfter reading the authors' response to my review, I decided to leave the score as is.[[CLA-POS],[JUS-POS],[DEP-POS],[FAI-POS],[CON-POS],[ENG-POS],[ACC-POS],[CST-POS],[NOV-POS],[ETH-NEG]]
