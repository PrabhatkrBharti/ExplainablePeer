This paper presents a novel application of machine learning using Graph NN's on ASTs to identify incorrect variable usage and predict variable names in context.  It is evaluated on a corpus of 29M SLOC, which is a substantial strength of the paper. \n\nThe paper is to be commended for the following aspects:\n1) Detailed description of GGNNs and their comparison to LSTMs \n2) The inclusion of ablation studies to strengthen the analysis of the proposed technique \n3) Validation on real-world software data \n4) The performance of the technique is reasonable enough to actually be used. \n\nIn reviewing the paper the following questions come to mind:\n1) Is the false positive rate too high to be practical?   How should this be tuned so developers would want to use the tool? \n2) How does the approach generalize to other languages? (Presumably well, but something to consider for future work.) \n\nDespite these questions, though, this paper is a nice addition to deep learning applications on software data and I believe it should be accepted.\n\n[[CLA-POS],[JUS-POS],[DEP-POS],[FAI-POS],[CON-POS],[ENG-POS],[ACC-POS],[CST-POS],[NOV-POS],[ETH-NEG]]
