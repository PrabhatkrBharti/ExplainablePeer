The paper adds to the discussion on the question whether Generative Adversarial Nets (GANs) learn the target distribution.  Recent theoretical analysis of GANs by Arora et al. show that of the discriminator capacity of is bounded, then there is a solution the closely meets the objective but the output distribution has a small support.  The paper attempts to estimate the size of the support for solutions produced by typical GANs experimentally.  The main idea used to estimate the support is the Birthday theorem that says that with probability at least 1/2, a uniform sample (with replacement) of size S from a set of  N elements will have a duplicate given S > \\sqrt{N}.  The suggested plan is to manually check for duplicates in a sample of size s and if duplicate exists, then estimate the size of the support to be s^2.  One should note that the birthday theorem assumes uniform sampling.   In the revised versions, it has been clarified that the tested distribution is not assumed to be uniform but the distribution has \"effectively\" small support size using an indistinguishability notion.  Given this method to estimate the size of the support, the paper also tries to study the behaviour of estimated support size with the discriminator capacity.  Arora et al. showed that the output support size has nearly linear dependence on the discriminator capacity.  Experiments are conducted in this paper to study this behaviour by varying the discriminator capacity and then estimating the support size using the idea described above.  A result similar to that of Arora et al. is also given for the special case of Encoder-Decoder GAN. \n\nEvaluation: \nSignificance: The question whether GANs learn the target distribution is important and any  significant contribution to this discussion is of value.  \n\nClarity: The paper is written well and the issues raised are well motivated and proper background is given.  \n\nOriginality: The main idea of trying to estimate the size of the support using a few samples by using birthday theorem seems new.  \n\nQuality: The main idea of this work is to give a estimation technique for the support size for the output distribution of GANs. \n[[CLA-NEG],[JUS-NEG],[DEP-NEG],[FAI-NEG],[CON-NEG],[ENG-NEG],[ACC-NEG],[CST-NEG],[NOV-NEG],[ETH-NEG]]
