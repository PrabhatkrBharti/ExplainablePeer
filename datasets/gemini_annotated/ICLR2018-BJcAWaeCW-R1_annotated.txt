The authors try to combine the power of GANs with hierarchical community structure detections.  While the idea is sound,  many design choices of the system is questionable.  The problem is particularly aggravated by the poor presentation of the paper, creating countless confusions for readers.  I do not recommend the acceptance of this draft. \n\nCompared with GAN, traditional graph analytics is model-specific and non-adaptive to training data.  This is also the case for hierarchical community structures.  By building the whole architecture on the Louvain method, the proposed method is by no means truly model-agnostic.  In fact, if the layers are fine enough, a significant portion of the network structure will be captured by the sum-up module instead of the GAN modules, rendering the overall behavior dominated by the community detection algorithm.  \n\nThe evaluation remains superficial with minimal quantitative comparisons.  Treating degree distribution and clustering coefficient (appeared as cluster coefficient in draft) as global features is problematic.   They are merely global average of local topological features which is incapable of capturing true long-distance structures in graphs.   \n\nThe writing of the draft leaves much to be desired.  The description of the architecture is confusing with design choices never clearly explained.  Multiple concepts needs better introduction, including the very name of their model GTI and the idea of stage identification.  Not to mention numerous grammatical errors, I suggest the authors seek professional English writing services.[[CLA-POS],[JUS-POS],[DEP-POS],[FAI-POS],[CON-POS],[ENG-NEG],[ACC-POS],[CST-POS],[NOV-POS],[ETH-NEG]]
