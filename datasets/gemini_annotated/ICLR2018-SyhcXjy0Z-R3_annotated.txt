This paper is an application paper on detecting when a face is disguised,  however it is poorly written and do not contribute much in terms of novelty of the approach.  The application domain is interesting,  however it is simply a classification problem \n\nThe paper is written clearly  (with mistakes in an equation), however, it does not contribute much in terms of novelty or new ideas. \n\nTo make the paper better, more empirical results are needed.  In addition, it would be useful to investigate how this particular problem is different than a binary classification problem using CNNs[[CLA-POS],[JUS-NEG],[DEP-POS],[FAI-POS],[CON-POS],[ENG-NEG],[ACC-NEG],[CST-POS],[NOV-NEG],[ETH-NEG]]
