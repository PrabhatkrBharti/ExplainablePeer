- This paper discusses an agent architecture which uses a shared representation to train multiple tasks with different sprite level visual statistics.  The key idea is that the agent learns a shared representations for tasks with different visual statistics \n\n- A lot of important references  touching on very similar ideas are missing.  For e.g. \"Unsupervised Pixel-level Domain Adaptation with Generative Adversarial Networks\", \"Using Simulation and Domain Adaptation to Improve Efficiency of Deep Robotic Grasping\", \"Schema Networks: Zero-shot Transfer with a Generative Causal Model of Intuitive Physics\".  \n\n- This paper has a lot of orthogonal details.  For instance sec 2.1 reviews the history of games and AI, which is besides the key point and does not provide any literary context.  \n\n- Only single runs for the results are shown in plots.  How statistically valid are the results? \n\n- In the last section authors mention the intent to do future work on atari and other env.  Given that this general idea has been discussed in the literature several times, it seems imperative to at least scale up the experiments before the paper is ready for publication[[CLA-NEG],[JUS-NEG],[DEP-NEG],[FAI-NEG],[CON-NEG],[ENG-NEG],[ACC-NEG],[CST-NEG],[NOV-NEG],[ETH-NEG]]
