This paper proposes using long term memory to solve combinatorial optimization problems with binary variables.  The authors do not exhibit much knowledge of combinatorial optimization literature (as has been pointed out by other readers) and ignore a lot of previous work by the combinatorial optimization community.  In particular, evaluating on random instances is not a good measure of performance,  as has already been pointed out.  The other issue is with the baseline solver, which also seems to be broken since their solution quality seems extremely poor.  In light of these issues, I recommend reject.[[CLA-NEG],[JUS-NEG],[DEP-NEG],[FAI-NEG],[CON-NEG],[ENG-NEG],[ACC-NEG],[CST-NEG],[NOV-NEG],[ETH-NEG]]
