Paper proposes a weak synchronization approach to synchronous SGD with the goal of improving even with slow parameter servers.  This is an improvement on earlier proposals (e.g. Revisiting Synchronous SGD) that allow for slow workers.  Empirical results on ResNet50 on CIFAR show promising results for simulations with slow workers and servers, with the proposed approach. \n\nIssues with the paper:\n- Since the paper is focused on empirical results, having results only for ResNet50 on CIFAR is very limiting\n- Empirical results are based on simulations and not real workloads.  The choice of simulation constants (% delayed, and delay time) seems somewhat arbitrary as well. \n- For the simulated results, the comparisons seem unfair since the validation error is different . It will be useful to also provide time to a certain accuracy that all of them get to e.g. the validation error of 0.1609 (reached by the 3 important cases). \n\nOverall, the paper proposes an interesting improvement to this area of synchronous training, however it is unable to validate the impact of this proposal.[[CLA-NEG],[JUS-NEG],[DEP-NEG],[FAI-NEG],[CON-NEG],[ENG-NEG],[ACC-NEG],[CST-NEG],[NOV-NEG],[ETH-NEG]]
