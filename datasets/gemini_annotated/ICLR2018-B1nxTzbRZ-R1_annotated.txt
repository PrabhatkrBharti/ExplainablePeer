The paper considers a problem of predicting hidden information in a poMDP with an application to Starcraft.  \n\nI find the problem of defogging quite interesting, even though it is a bit too Starcraft-specific some findings could perhaps be translated to other partially observed environments. \nAuthors use the dataset provided for Starcraft: Brood war by Lin et al, 2017. \n\nMy impression about the paper is that even though it touches a very interesting problem,  it neither is written well nor it contains much of a novelty in terms of algorithms, methods or network architectures. \n\nDetailed comments:\n* Authors should at very least cite (Vinyals et al, 2017) and explain why the environment and the dataset released for Starcraft 2 is less suited than the one provided by Lin et al. \n* Problem statement in section 3.1 should certainly be improved.  Authors introduce rather heavy notation which is then used in a confusing way.  For example, what is the top index in $s_t^{3-p}$ supposed to mean?  The notation is not much used after sec. 3.1, for example, figure 1 does not use it.  \n* A related issue, is that the definition of metrics is very informal and, again, does not use the already defined notation.  Including explicit formulas would be very helpful, because, for example, it looks like when reported in table 1 the metrics are spatially averaged, yet I could not find an explicit notion of that. \n* Authors seem to only consider deterministic defogging models.  However, to me it seems that even in 15 game steps the uncertainty over the hidden state is quite high and thus any deterministic model has a very limited potential in prediction it.  At least the concept of stochastic predictions should be discussed\n* The rule-based baselines are not described in detail.  What does \u201cusing game rules to infer the existence of unit types\u201d mean? \n* Another detail which I found missing is whether authors use just a screen, a mini-map or both.  In the game of Starcraft, only screen contains information about unit-types, but it\u2019s field of view is limited.  Hence, it\u2019s unclear to me whether a model should infer hidden information based on just a single screen + minimap observation (or a history of them) or due to how the dataset is constructed, all units are observed without spatial limitations of the screen. \n[[CLA-POS],[JUS-POS],[DEP-POS],[FAI-POS],[CON-POS],[ENG-POS],[ACC-POS],[CST-POS],[NOV-NEG],[ETH-POS]]
