The paper is relatively clear to follow, and implement.  \n\nThe main concern is that this looks like a class project rather than a scientific paper.  For a class project this could get an A in a ML class! \n\nIn particular, the authors take an already existing dataset, design a trivial convolutional neural network, and report results on it.  There is absolutely nothing of interest to ICLR except for the fact that now we know that a trivial network is capable of obtaining 90% accuracy on this dataset.[[CLA-NEG],[JUS-NEG],[DEP-NEG],[FAI-NEG],[CON-NEG],[ENG-NEG],[ACC-NEG],[CST-NEG],[NOV-NEG],[ETH-NEG]]
