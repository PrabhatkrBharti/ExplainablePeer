This paper presents an interesting idea to word embeddings that it combines a few base vectors to generate new word embeddings.  It also adopts an interesting multicodebook approach for encoding than binary embeddings.  \n\nThe paper presents the proposed approach to a few NLP problems and have shown that this is able to significant reduce the size, increase compression ratio, and still achieved good accuracy. \n\nThe experiments are convincing and solid.  Overall I am weakly inclined to accept this paper.[[CLA-POS],[JUS-POS],[DEP-POS],[FAI-POS],[CON-NEG],[ENG-POS],[ACC-POS],[CST-POS],[NOV-POS],[ETH-NEG]]
