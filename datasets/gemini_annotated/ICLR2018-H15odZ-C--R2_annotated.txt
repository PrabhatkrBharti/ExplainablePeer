The authors discuss a direct Gamma sampling method for the interpolated samples in GANs, and show the improvements over usual normal sampling for CelebA, MNIST, CIFAR and SVHN datasets. \n\nThe method involves a nice, albeit minor, trick, where the chi-squared distribution of the sum of the z_{i}^{2} has its dependence on the dimensionality removed . However I am not convinced by the distribution of \\|z^\\prime\\|^{2} in the first place (eqn (2)): the samples from the gaussian will be approximately orthogonal in high dimensions, but the inner product will be at least O(1) . Thus although the \\|z_{0}\\|^{2} and \\|z_{1}\\|^{2} are chi-squared/gamma, I don't think \\|z^\\prime\\|^{2} is exactly gamma in general. \n\nThe experiments do show that the interpolated samples are qualitatively better, but a thorough empirical analysis for different dimensionalities would be welcome.  Figures 2 and 3 do not add anything to the story, since 2 is just a plot of gamma pdfs and 3 shows the difference between the constant KL and the normal case that is linear in d.  \n\nOverall I think the trick needs to be motivated better, and the experiments improved to really show the import of the d-independence of the KL.  Thus I think this paper is below the acceptance threshold.[[CLA-NEG],[JUS-NEG],[DEP-NEG],[FAI-NEG],[CON-NEG],[ENG-NEG],[ACC-NEG],[CST-NEG],[NOV-NEG],[ETH-NEG]]
