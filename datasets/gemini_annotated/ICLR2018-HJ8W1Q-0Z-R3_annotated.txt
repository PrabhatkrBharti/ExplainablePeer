The paper proposed an extension to the fast weights from Ba et al. to include additional gating units for changing the fast weights learning rate adaptively.  The authors empirically demonstrated the gated fast weights outperforms other baseline methods on the associative retrieval task. \n\nComment:\n\n- I found the paper very hard to follow.  The authors could improve the clarity of the paper greatly by listing their contribution clearly for readers to digest.  The authors should emphasize the first half of the method section are from existing works and should go into a separate background section. \n\n- Overall, the only contribution of the paper seems to be the modification to Ba et al. is the Eq. (8).  The authors have only evaluated the method on a synthetic associative retrieval task.  Without additional experiments on other datasets, it is hard for the reader to draw any meaningful conclusion about the proposed method in general[[CLA-NEG],[JUS-POS],[DEP-POS],[FAI-POS],[CON-POS],[ENG-POS],[ACC-POS],[CST-POS],[NOV-POS],[ETH-NEG]]
