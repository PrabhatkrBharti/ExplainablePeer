The work claims a measure of robustness of networks that is attack-agnostic.  Robustness measure is turned into the problem of finding a local Lipschitz constant which is given by the maximum of the norm of the gradient of the associated function.  That quantity is then estimated by sampling from the domain of maximization and observing the maximum value of the norm out of those samples.  Such a maximum process is then described by the reverse Weibull distribution which is used in the estimation. \n\nThe paper closely follows Hein and Andriushchenko (2017).  There is a slight modification that enlarges the class of functions for which the theory is applicable (Lemma 3.3).  As far as I know, the contribution of the work starts in Section 4 where the authors show how to practically estimate the maximum process through back-prop where mini-batching helps increase the number of samples.  This is a rather simple idea that is shown to be effective in Figure 3.  The following section (the part starting from 5.3) presents the key to the success of the proposed measure.  \n\nThis is an important problem and the paper attempts to tackle it in a computationally efficient way.  The fact that the norms of attacks are slightly above the proposed score is promising, however, there is always the risk of finding a lower bound that is too small (zeros and large gaps in Figure 3).  It would be nice to be able to show that one can find corresponding attacks that are not too far away from the proposed score. \n\nFinally, a minor point: Definition 3.1 has a confusing notation, f is a K-valued vector throughout the paper but it also denotes the number that represents the prediction in Definition 3.1. I believe this is just a typo. \n\nEdit: Thanks for the fixes and clarification of essential parts in the paper[[CLA-POS],[JUS-POS],[DEP-POS],[FAI-POS],[CON-POS],[ENG-POS],[ACC-POS],[CST-POS],[NOV-POS],[ETH-NEG]]
