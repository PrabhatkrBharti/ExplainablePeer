This paper utilizes ACOL algorithm for unsupervised learning.  ACOL can be considered a type of semi-supervised learning where the learner has access only to parent-class information (for example in digit recognition whether a digit is bigger than 5 or not) and not the sub-class information (number between 0-9) . Given that in many applications such parent-class supervised information is not available , the authors of this paper propose domain specific pseudo parent-class labels (for example transformed images of digits) to adapt ACOL for unsupervised learning . The authors also modified affinity and balance term utilized in GAR (as part of ACOL algorithm) to improve it.  The authors use multiple data sets to study different aspects of the proposed approach .\n\nI updated my scores based on the reviewers responses.  It turned out that ACOL and GAR are also originally proposed by the same authors and was only published in arxiv!  Because of the double-blind review nature of ICLR, I didn't know these ideas came from the same authors and is being published for the first time in a peer-reviewed venue (ICLR) . So my main problem with this paper, lack of novelty, is addressed and my score has changed.  Thanks to the reviewer for clarifying this.\n[[CLA-NEG],[JUS-NEG],[DEP-NEG],[FAI-NEG],[CON-NEG],[ENG-NEG],[ACC-NEG],[CST-NEG],[NOV-NEG],[ETH-NEG]]
