This paper studies problems that can be solved using a dynamic programming approach and proposes a neural network architecture called Divide and Conquer Networks (DCN) to solve such problems.  The network has two components: one component learns to split the problem and the other learns to combine solutions to sub-problems.  Using this setup, the authors are able to beat sequence to sequence baselines on problems that are amenable to such an approach.  In particular the authors test their approach on computing convex hulls, computing a minimum cost k-means clustering, and the Euclidean Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) problem.  In all three cases, the proposed solution outperforms the baselines on larger problem instances. [[CLA-POS],[JUS-POS],[DEP-POS],[FAI-POS],[CON-NEG],[ENG-POS],[ACC-POS],[CST-POS],[NOV-POS],[ETH-NEG]]
