MARS is suggested to combine multiple adversaries with different roles. \nExperiments show that it is suited to create censoring representations for increased anonymisation of data in the context of wearables. \n\nExperiments a are satisfying and show good performance when compared to other methods. \n\nIt could be made clearer how significance is tested given the frequent usage of the term. \n\nThe idea is slightly novel, and the framework otherwise state-of-the-art. \n\nThe paper is well written, but can use some proof-reading. \n\nReferencing is okay[[CLA-NEG],[JUS-NEG],[DEP-NEG],[FAI-NEG],[CON-NEG],[ENG-NEG],[ACC-NEG],[CST-NEG],[NOV-NEG],[ETH-NEG]]
