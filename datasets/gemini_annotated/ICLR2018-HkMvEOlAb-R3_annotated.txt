The paper is well written and clear . The main idea is to exploit a schema of semisupervised learning based on ACOL and GAR for an unsupervised learning task . The idea is to introduce the notion of pseudo labelling.  \nPseudo labelling can be obtained by transformations of original input data .\nThe key point is the definition of the transformations . \nOnly whether the design of transformation captures the latent representation of the input data, the pseudo-labelling might improve the performance of the unsupervised learning task .\nSince it is not known in advance what might be a good set of transformations,  it is not clear what is the behaviour of the model when the large portion of transformations are not encoding the latent representation of clusters.[[CLA-POS],[JUS-POS],[DEP-POS],[FAI-POS],[CON-POS],[ENG-POS],[ACC-POS],[CST-NEG],[NOV-POS],[ETH-NEG]]
