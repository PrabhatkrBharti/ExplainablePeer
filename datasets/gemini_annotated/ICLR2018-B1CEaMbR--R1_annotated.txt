This paper presents some reviews on clustering methods with deep learning.  Based on the review taxonomy, the authors presents a mixed objective which aims for bretter clustering performance.  The proposed method is then tested on two image data sets.\n\n The claimed main contribution of the paper is the taxonomy.  There are no new things in such kind of reviews.  The taxonomy gives no scientific axioms.  Therefore the impact or actual contribution to the ICLR community is very limited.\n\n The proposed clustering method is problematic.  It is hard to set the paramter alpha.  The experimental results are also disappointing.  For example, the COIL20 accuracy is only 0.762, much worse than the state of the art.  Moreover, results on only two image data sets are not sufficient for convincing.[[CLA-NEG],[JUS-NEG],[DEP-NEG],[FAI-NEG],[CON-NEG],[ENG-NEG],[ACC-NEG],[CST-NEG],[NOV-NEG],[ETH-NEG]]
