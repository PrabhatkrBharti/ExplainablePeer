\n\nThis paper presented interesting ideas to reduce the redundancy in convolution kernels.  They are very close to existing algorithms .\n\n(1)\tThe SW-SC kernel (Figure 2 (a)) is an extension of the existing shaped kernel (Figure 1 (c)). \n(2)\tThe CW-SC kernel (Figure 2 (c)) is very similar to interleaved group convolutions.  The CW-SC kernel can be regarded as a redundant version of interleaved group convolutions [1].  \n\nI would like to see more discussions on the relation to these methods and more strong arguments for convincing reviewers to accept this paper.  \n\n[1] Interleaved Group Convolutions.
