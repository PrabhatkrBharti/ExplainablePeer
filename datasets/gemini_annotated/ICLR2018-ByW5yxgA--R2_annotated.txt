This paper proposes a variant of hierarchical hidden Markov Models (HMMs) where the chains operate at different time-scales with an associate d spectral estimation procedure that is computationally efficient. \n\nThe model is applied to artificially generated data and to high-frequency equity data showing promising results. \n\nThe proposed model and method are reasonably original and novel. \n\nThe paper is well written and the method reasonably well explained  (I would add an explanation of the spectral estimation in the Appendix, rather than just citing Rodu et al. 2013). \n\nAdditional experimental results would make it a stronger paper. \n\nIt would be great if the authors could include the code that implements the model[[CLA-NEG],[JUS-NEG],[DEP-NEG],[FAI-NEG],[CON-NEG],[ENG-NEG],[ACC-NEG],[CST-NEG],[NOV-NEG],[ETH-NEG]]
