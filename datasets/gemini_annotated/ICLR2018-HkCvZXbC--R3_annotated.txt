\n- Paper summary\n\nThe paper proposes a label-conditional GAN generator architecture and a GAN training objective for the image modeling task.  The proposed GAN generator consists of two components where one focuses on generating foreground while the other focuses on generating background.  The GAN training objective function utilizing 3 conditional classifier.  It is shown that through combining the generator architecture and the GAN training objective function, one can learn a foreground--background decomposed generative model in an unsupervised manner . The paper shows results on the MNIST, SVHN, and Celebrity Faces datasets. \n\n- Poor experimental validation\n\nWhile it is interesting to know that a foreground--background decomposed generative model can be learned in an unsupervised manner,  it is clear how this capability can help practical applications, especially no such examples are shown in the paper.  The paper also fails to provide any quantitative evaluation of the proposed method.  For example, the paper will be more interesting if inception scores were shown for various challenging datasets.   In additional, there is no ablation study analyzing impacts of each design choices . As a result, the paper carries very little scientific value.[[CLA-NEG],[JUS-NEG],[DEP-NEG],[FAI-NEG],[CON-NEG],[ENG-NEG],[ACC-NEG],[CST-NEG],[NOV-NEG],[ETH-NEG]]
