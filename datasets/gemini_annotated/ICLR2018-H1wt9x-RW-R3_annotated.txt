This paper looks at a specific aspect of the learning-to-teach problem, where the learner is assumed to have a teacher that selects training examples for the student according to a strategy.  The teacher's strategy should also be  learned from data.   In this case the authors look at finding interpretable teaching strategies.   The authors define the \"good\" strategies as similar to intuitive strategies (based on human intuition about the structure of the domain) or strategies that are effective for teaching humans.   \nThe suggested method follow an iterative process in which the student and teacher are interchangeably used.  At each iteration the teacher generates  examples based on the students current concept.  \n\nI found it very difficult to follow the claims in the paper.  Why is it assumed that human intuition is necessarily good?   The experiments do not answer these questions, but are designed to show that the suggested approach follows human intuition.  There are not enough details to get a good grasp of the suggested method and the different choices for it,  and similarly the experiments are not described in a very convincing way.  Specifically - the domains picked seem very contrived,  there actual results are not reported, the size of the data seems minimal so it's not clear what is actually learned. \nHow would you analyze the teaching strategy in realistic cases, where there is no simple intuitive strategy? This would be more convincing.[[CLA-POS],[JUS-NEG],[DEP-POS],[FAI-POS],[CON-POS],[ENG-POS],[ACC-POS],[CST-REG],[NOV-NEG],[ETH-NEG]]
