1. This is a good application paper, can be quite interesting in a workshop related to Deep Learning applications to physical sciences and engineering. \n2. Lacks in sufficient machine learning related novelty required to be relevant in the main conference \n3. Design, solving inverse problem using Deep Learning are not quite novel, see\nStoecklein et al. Deep Learning for Flow Sculpting: Insights into Efficient Learning using Scientific Simulation Data. Scientific Reports 7, Article number: 46368 (2017). \n4. However, this paper introduces two different types of networks for \"parametrization\" and \"physical behavior\" mapping, which is interesting, can be very useful as surrogate models for CFD simulations.  \n5. It will be interesting to see the impacts of physics based knowledge on choice of network architecture, hyper-parameters and other training considerations. \n6. Just claiming the generalization capability of deep networks is not enough, need to show how much the model can interpolate or extrapolate?  what are the effects of regulariazations in this regard?
