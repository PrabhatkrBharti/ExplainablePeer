The paper takes a closer look at the analysis of SGD as variational inference, first proposed by Duvenaud et al. 2016\nand Mandt et al. 2016.  In particular, the authors point out that in general, SGD behaves quite differently from Langevin diffusion due to the multivariate nature of the Gaussian noise.   As the authors show based on the Fokker-Planck equation of the underlying stochastic process, there exists a conservative current (a gradient of an underlying potential) and a non-conservative current (which might induce stationary persistent currents at long times).  The non-conservative part leads to the fact that the dynamics of SGD\tmay show oscillations, and these oscillations may even prevent the algorithm from converging to the 'right' local optima.  The theoretical analysis is carried-out very nicely, and the theory is supported by experiments on two-dimensional toy examples, and Fourier-spectra of the iterates of SGD. \n\nThis is a nice paper which I would like to see accepted.  In particular I appreciate that the authors stress the importance\nof 'non-equilibrium physics' for understanding the SGD process.  Also, the presentation is quite clear and the paper well written. \n\nThere are a few minor points which I would like to ask the authors to address:\n\n1. Why cite Kingma and Welling as a source for variational inference in\tsection 3.1?  VI is a much older\tfield, and Kingma and Welling proposed a very special form of VI, namely amortized VI with inference networks.  A better citation would be Jordan et\tal 1999. \n\n2. I'm not sure how much to trust the Fourier-spectra.  In particular, perhaps the deviations from Brownian motion could also be due to the discrete\tnature of SGD (i.e. that the continuous-time formalism is only an approximation of a discrete process).   Could you elaborate on this?  \n\n3. Could you give the reader more details on how the uncertainty estimates on the Fourier transformations were obtained?\n\nThanks.[[CLA-NEG],[JUS-NEG],[DEP-NEG],[FAI-NEG],[CON-NEG],[ENG-NEG],[ACC-NEG],[CST-NEG],[NOV-NEG],[ETH-NEG]]
