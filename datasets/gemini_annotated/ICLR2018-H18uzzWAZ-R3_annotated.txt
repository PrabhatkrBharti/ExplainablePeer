This contribution deal with nuisance factors afflicting biological cell images with a domain adaptation approach: the embedding vectors generated from cell images show spurious correlation.  The authors define a Wasserstein Distance Network to find  a suitable affine transformation that reduces the nuisance factor.  The evaluation on a real dataset yields correct results, this approach is quite general and could be applied to different problems. \n\nThe contribution of this approach could be better highlighted.  The early stopping criteria tend to favor suboptimal solution, indeed relying on the Cramer distance is possible improvement. \n\nAs a side note, the k-NN MOA is central to for the evaluation of the proposed approach.  A possible improvement is to try other means for the embedding instead of the Euclidean one.\n\n[[CLA-NEG],[JUS-NEG],[DEP-NEG],[FAI-NEG],[CON-NEG],[ENG-NEG],[ACC-NEG],[CST-NEG],[NOV-NEG],[ETH-NEG]]
