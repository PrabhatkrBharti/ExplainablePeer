 "The paper proposes an approach to train generators within a GAN framework, in the setting where one has access only to degraded / imperfect measurements of real samples, rather than the samples themselves.  Broadly, the approach is to have a generator produce the \"full\" real data, pass it through a simulated model of the measurement process, and then train the discriminator to distinguish between these simulated measurements of generated samples, and true measurements of real samples.  By this mechanism, the proposed method is able to train GANs to generate high-quality samples from only imperfect measurements. \n\nThe paper is largely well-written and well-motivated, the overall setup is interesting (I find the authors' practical use cases convincing---where one only has access to imperfect data in the first place), and the empirical results are convincing.  The theoretical proofs do make strong assumptions (in particular, the fact that the true distribution must be uniquely constrained by its marginal along the measurement).  However, in most theoretical analysis of GANs and neural networks in general, I view proofs as a means of gaining intuition rather than being strong guarantees---and to that end, I found the analysis in this paper to be informative. \n\nI would make a  suggestions for possible further experimental analysis: it would be nice to see how robust the approach is to systematic mismatches between the true and modeled measurement functions (for instance, slight differences in the blur kernels, noise variance, etc.).  Especially in the kind of settings the paper considers, I imagine it may sometimes also be hard to accurately model the measurement function of a device (or it may be necessary to use a computationally cheaper approximation for training).  I think a study of how such mismatches affect the training procedure would be instructive (perhaps more so than some of the quantitative evaluation given that they at best only approximately measure sample quality)."
