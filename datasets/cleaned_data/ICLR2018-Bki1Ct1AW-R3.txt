 "In this contribution, the authors propose an improvement of a tensor decomposition method for decoding spike train.  Relying on a non-negative matrix factorization, the authors tackle the influence of the baseline activity on the decomposition.  The main consequence is that the retrieved components are not necessarily non-negative and the proposed decomposition rely on signed activation coefficients.  An experimental validation shows that for high frequency baseline (> 0.7 Hz), the baseline corrected algorithm yields better classification results than non-corrected version (and other common factorization techniques). \n\n The objective function is defined with a Frobenius norm, which has an important influence on the obtained solutions, as it could be seen on Figure 2.  The proposed method seems to provide a more discriminant factorization than the NMF one, at the expense of the sparsity of spatial and temporal components, impeding the biological interpretability.   A possible solution is to add a regularization term to the objective function to ensure the sparsity of the factorization."
