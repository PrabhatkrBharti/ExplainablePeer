 "This is quite an interesting paper. Thank you.  Here are a few comments:\n\nI think this style of writing theoretical papers is pretty good, where the main text aims of preserving a coherent story while the technicalities of the proofs are sent to the appendix.  \nHowever I would have appreciated a little bit more details about the proofs in the main text (maybe more details about the construct that is involved).  I can appreciate though that this a fine line to walk.  Also in the appendix, please restate the lemma that is being proven.  Otherwise one will have to scroll up and down all the time to understand the proof.  \n\nI think the paper could also discuss a bit more in detail the results provided.  For example a discussion of how practical is the algorithm proposed for exact counting of linear regions would be nice.  Though regardless, I think the findings speak for themselves and this seems an important step forward in understanding neural nets.  \n\n****************\nI had reduced my score based on the observation made by Reviewer 1 regarding the talk Montufar at SampTA.  Could the authors prioritize clarification to that point !  \n - Thanks for the clarification and adding this citation. "
