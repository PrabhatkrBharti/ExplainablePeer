 "The paper entitled 'Siamese Survival Analysis' reports an application of a deep learning to three cases of competing risk survival analysis.  The author follow the reasoning that '... these ideas were not explored in the context of survival analysis', thereby disregarding the significant published literature based on the Concordance Index (CI).  \n\nBesides this deficit, the paper does not present a proper statistical setup (e.g. 'Is censoring assumed to be at random? ...) , and numerical results are only referring to some standard implementations, thereby again neglecting the state-of-the-art solution.  That being said, this particular use of deep learning in this context might be novel.
