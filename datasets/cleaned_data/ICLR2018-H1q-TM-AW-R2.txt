 "As there are many kinds of domain adaptation problems, the need to mix several learning strategies to improve the existing approaches is obvious. However, this task is not necessarily easy to succeed.  The authors proposed a sound approach to learn a proper representation (in an adversarial way) and comply the cluster assumption. \n\nThe experiments show that this Virtual Adversarial Domain Adaptation network (VADA) achieves great results when compared to existing learning algorithms.  Moreover, we also see the learned model is consistently improved using the proposed \"Decision-boundary Iterative Refinement Training with a Teacher\" (DIRT-T) approach. \n\nThe proposed methodology relies on multiple choices that could sometimes be better studied and/or explained.  Namely, I would like to empirically see which role of the locally-Lipschitz regularization term (Equation 7).  Also, I wonder why this term is tuned by an hyperparameter (lamda_s) for the source, while a single hyperparamer (lambda_t) is used for the sum of the two target quantity. \n \nOn the theoretical side, the discussion could be improved. Namely, Section 3 about \"limitation of domain adversarial training\" correctly explained that \"domain adversarial training may not be sufficient for domain adaptation if the feature extraction function has high-capacity\".  It would be interesting to explain whether this observation is consistent with Theorem 1 of the paper (due to Ben-David et al., 2010), on which several domain adversarial approaches are based.  The need to consider supplementary assumptions (such as ) to achieve good adaptation can also be studied through the lens of more recent Ben-David's work, e.g. Ben-David and Urner (2014).  In the latter, the notion of \"Probabilistic Lipschitzness\", which is a relaxation of the \"cluster assumption\" seems very related to the actual work.\n\nReference:\nBen-David and Urner.
