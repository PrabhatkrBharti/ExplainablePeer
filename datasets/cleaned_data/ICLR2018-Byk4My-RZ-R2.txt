 "The paper demonstrates the need and usage for flexible priors in the latent space alongside current priors used for the generator network.  These priors are indirectly induced from the data - the example discussed is via an empirical diagonal covariance assumption for a multivariate Gaussian.  The experimental results show the benefits of this approach.  \nThe paper provides for a good read.  \n\nComments:\n\n1. How do the PAG scores differ when using a full covariance structure?  Diagonal covariances are still very restrictive.  \n2. The results are depicted with a latent space of 20 dimensions.  It will be informative to see how the model holds in high-dimensional settings.  And when data can be sparse.  \n3. You could consider giving the Discriminator, real data etc in Fig 1 for completeness as a graphical summary.
