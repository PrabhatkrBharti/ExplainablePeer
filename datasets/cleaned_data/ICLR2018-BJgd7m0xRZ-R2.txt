 "In this paper, the authors explore how using random projections can be used to make OCSVM robust to adversarially perturbed training data.   While the intuition is nice and interesting,  the paper is not very clear in describing the attack and the experiments do not appropriately test whether this method actually provides robustness. \n\nDetails:\nhave been successfully in anomaly detection --> have been successfully used in anomaly detectionP \n\n\"The adversary would select a random subset of anomalies, push them towards the normal data cloud and inject these perturbed points into the training set\" -- This seems backwards.   As in the example that follows, if the adversary wants to make anomalies seem normal at test time, it should move normal points outward from the normal point cloud (eg making a 9 look like a weird 7). \n\nAs s_attack increases, the anomaly data points are moved farther away from the normal data cloud, altering the position of the separating hyperplane. -- This seems backwards from Fig 2.    From (a) to (b) the red points move closer to the center while in (c) they move further away (why?).    The blue points seem to consistently become more dense from (a) to (c).  \n\nThe attack model is too rough.    It seems that without bounding D, we can make the model arbitrarily bad, no?    Assumption 1 alludes to this but doesn't specify what is \"small\"?    Also the attack model is described without considering if the adversary knows the learner's algorithm.    Even if there is randomness, can the adversary take actions that account for that randomness?  \n\nDoes selecting a projection based on compactness remove the randomness?  \n\nExperiments -- why/how would you have distorted test data?    Making an anomaly seem normal by distorting it is easy.  \n\nI don't see experiments comparing having random projections and not.    This seems to be the fundamental question -- do random projects help in the train_D | test_C case?  \n\nExperiments don't vary the attack much to understand how robust the method is."
