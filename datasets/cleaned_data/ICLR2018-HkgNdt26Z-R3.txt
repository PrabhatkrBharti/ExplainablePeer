 "This paper discusses the application of word prediction for software keyboards.  The goal is to customize the predictions for each user to account for member specific information while adhering to the strict compute constraints and privacy requirements.  \n\nThe authors propose a simple method of mixing the global model with user specific data.  Collecting the user specific models and averaging them to form the next global model.  \n\nThe proposal is practical.  However, I am not convinced that this is novel enough for publication at ICLR.  \n\nOne major question.  The authors assume that the global model will depict general english.  However, it is not necessary that the population of users will adhere to general English and hence the averaged model at the next time step t+1 might be significantly different from general English.  It is not clear to me as how this mechanism guarantees that it will not over-fit or that there will be no catastrophic forgetting.
