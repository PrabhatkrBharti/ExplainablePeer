 "This paper proposed an improved version of dynamic coattention networks, which is used for question answering tasks.  Specifically, there are 2 aspects to improve DCN: one is to use a mixed objective that combines cross entropy with self-critical policy learning, the other one is to imporve DCN with deep residual coattention encoder.  The proposed model achieved STOA performance on Stanford Question Asnwering Dataset  and several ablation experiments show the effectiveness of these two improvements.  Although DCN+ is an improvement of DCN, I think the improvement is not incremental.  \n\nOne question is that since the model is compicated, will the authors release the source code to repeat all the experimental results?"
