 "[Apologies for short review, I got called in late.  Marking my review as \"educated guess\" since i didn't have time for a detailed review] \n\nThe paper proposes an algorithm to tune the momentum and learning rate for SGD.  While the algorithm does not have a theory for general non-quadratic functions,  experimental validation is extensive, making it a worthy contribution in my opinion.  I have personally tried the algorithm when the paper came out and can vouch for the empirical results presented here."
