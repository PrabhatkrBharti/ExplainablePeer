 "Summary of the paper: The paper analysis how well difference target probation (DTP) - an optimisation algorithm designed to be biologically more plausible than backpropagation - scales to bigger datasets like CIFAR-10 and ImageNet.   The DTP algorithm is slightly adapted to make it more biologically plausible, by replacing the gradient computation the original paper applied between the highest hidden layers by target propagation (leading to the variant SDTP), and by making the optimisation of both involved losses parallel.   Furthermore, only feedforward and locally connected networks (CNN) are considered since their architecture is considered more biologically plausible than convolutional neural networks.  While on MNIST and CIFAR, DTP and SDTP performed as well as backprop, they perform worse on ImageNet . Furthermore, it becomes clear, that without CNN structure no really good performance is achieved neither on CIFAR nor on ImageNet  \n\nPros:\n- The paper is nicely written and good to follow. \n- Suggested modifications from DTP to STDP increase its biological plausibility without making its performance worse.  \n- The worse performance compared to backprop and CNNs underlines the open question how to yield biologically plausible AND efficient algorithms and network architectures.  \n\nCons:\n- The title of the paper seems to general to me, since target propagation is the only algorithm compared against backpropagation.  \n- Since the adaptions to DTP are rather small, the work does not contain much novelty.  It can rather be seen as an interesting empirical study, with \"negative result\ ".\n\n\nMinor comments:\n- page 1: The reference list could also include  http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1162/NECO_a_00934 and  https://arxiv.org/abs/1510.02777\n-  page 5: \u201cthe the degree\u201d , \u201cspecified as (\u2026.) followed by\u201d -> , \u201cas (\u2026.) followed by\u201d ?,\n- This notation probably stems from the code, but SAME and VALID could be nicer described as \u201c0 padding\u201d and \u201cno padding\u201d  for example.\n- page 8:  \u201capplying BP to the brain\u201d sounds strange to me.\n"
