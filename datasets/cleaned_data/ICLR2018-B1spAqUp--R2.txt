 "Paper summary:\nThis paper proposes a technique to generalize deconvolution operations used in standard CNN architectures.  Traditional deconvolution operation uses independent filter weights to compute output features at adjacent pixels.  This work proposes to do sequential prediction of adjacent pixel features (via intermediate feature maps) resulting in more spatially smooth outputs for deconvolution layer.  This new layer is referred to as \u2018pixel deconvolution layer\u2019 and it is demonstrated on two tasks of semantic segmentation and face generation. \n\n\nPaper Strengths:\n- Despite being simple technique, the proposed pixel deconvolution layer is novel and interesting.
