 "This paper discusses several gradient based attribution methods, which have been popular for the fast computation of saliency maps for interpreting deep neural networks.  The paper provides several advances:\n- \\epsilon-LRP and DeepLIFT are formulated in a way that can be calculated using the same back-propagation as training. \n- This gives a more unified way of understanding, and implementing the methods. \n- The paper points out situations when the methods are equivalent \n- The paper analyses the methods' sensitivity to identifying single and joint regions of sensitivity \n- The paper proposes a new objective function to measure joint sensitivity \n\nOverall, I believe this paper to be a useful contribution to the literature.  It both solidifies understanding of existing methods and provides new insight into quantitate ways of analysing methods.  Especially the latter will be appreciated."
