 "This paper investigates an effect of time dependencies in a specific type of RNN. \n\nThe idea is important and this paper seems sound . However, I am not sure that the main result (Theorem 1) explains an effect of depth sufficiently. \n\n--Main comment\nAbout the deep network case in Theorem 1, how $L$ affects the bound on ranks?  In the current statement, the result seems independent to $L$ when $L \\geq 2$.  I think that this paper should quantify the effect of an increase of $L$. \n\n--Sub comment\nNumerical experiments for calculating the separation rank is necessary to provide evidence of the main result.  Only a simple example will make this paper more convincing.
