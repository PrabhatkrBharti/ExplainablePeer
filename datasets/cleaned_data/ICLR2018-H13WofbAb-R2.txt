 "This paper considers distributed synchronous SGD, and proposes to use \"partial pulling\" to alleviate the problem with slow servers. \n\nThe motivation is that the server may be a straggler.  The authors suggested one possibility, namely that the server and some workers are located on the same machine and the workers take most of the computational resource . However, if this is the case, a simple solution would be to move the server to a different node.  A more convincing argument for a slow server should be provided .\n\nThough the authors claimed that they used 3 techniques to accelerate synchronous SGD, only partial pulling is proposed by them (the other 2 are borrowed straightforwardly from existing papers).  The mechanism of partial pulling is very simple (just let SGD proceed after pulling a partial parameter block instead of the whole block).  As mentioned by the authors in section 1, any relaxation in synchrony brings more noise and higher variance to the updates, and also may cause slow convergence or convergence to a poor solution.  However, the authors provided no theoretical study on any of these aspects. \n\nExperimental results are not convincing.  Only one relatively small dataset (cifar10) is used Moreover, the slow server problem is only simulated by artificially adding delays to the server."
