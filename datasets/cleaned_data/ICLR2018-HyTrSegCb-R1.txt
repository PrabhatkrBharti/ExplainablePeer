 "The paper is a pain to read.  Most of the citation styles are off (i.e., without parentheses).  Most of the sentences are not grammatically correct.  Most, if not all, of the determiners are missing.  It is ironic that the paper is proposing a model to generate grammatically correct sentences, while most of the sentences in the paper are not grammatically correct. \n\nThe experimental numbers look skeptical.  For example, 1/3 of the training results are worse than the test results in Table 1.  It also happens a few times in Table 5.  Either the models are not properly trained, or the models are heavily tuned on the test set. \n\nThe running times in Table 9 are also skeptical.  Why are the Concorde models faster than unigrams and bigrams?  Maybe this can be attributed to the difference in the size of the vocabulary, but why is the unigram model slower than the bigram model?"
