 "This paper introduces a machine learning adaptation of the active inference framework proposed by Friston (2010), and applies it to the task of image classification on MNIST through a foveated inspection of images.  It describes a cognitive architecture for the same, and provide analyses in terms of processing compression and \"confirmation biases\" in the model. \n\u2013 Active perception, and more specifically recognition through saccades (or viewpoint selection) is an interesting biologically-inspired approach and seems like an intuitive and promising way to improve efficiency.  The problem and its potential applications are well motivated. \n\u2013 The perception-driven control formulation is well-detailed and simple to follow. \n\u2013 The achieved compression rates are significant and impressive, though additional demonstration of performance on more challenging datasets would have been more compelling \n\nQuestions and comments:\n\u2013 While an 85% compression rate is significant, 88% accuracy on MNIST seems poor.  A plot demonstrating the tradeoff of \naccuracy for compression (by varying Href or other parameters) would provide a more complete picture of performance.  Knowing baseline performance (without active inference) would help put numbers in perspective by providing a performance bound due to modeling choices. \n\u2013\u00a0What does the distribution of number of saccades required per recognition (for a given threshold) look like over the entire dataset, i.e. how many are dead-easy vs difficult? \n\u2013 Steady state assumption: How can this be relaxed to further generalize to non-static scenes? \n\u2013 Figure 3 is low resolution and difficult to read. \n\nPost-rebuttal comments:\n\nI have revised my score after considering comments from other reviewers and the revised paper.  While the revised version contains more experimental details,  the paper in its present form lacks comparisons to other gaze selection and saliency models which are required to put results in context.  The paper also contains grammatical errors and is somewhat difficult to understand.  Finally, while it proposes an interesting formulation of a well-studied problem , more comparisons and analysis are required to validate the approach.
