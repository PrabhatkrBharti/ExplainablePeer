 "This paper proposed a class of control variate methods based on Stein's identity.  Stein's identity has been widely used in classical statistics and recently in statistical machine learning literature.  Nevertheless, applying Stein's identity to estimating policy gradient is a novel approach in reinforcement learning community.  To me, this approach is the right way of constructing control variates for estimating policy gradient.  The authors also did a good job in connecting with existing works and gave concrete examples for Gaussian policies.  The experimental results also look promising. \n\nIt would be nice to include some theoretical analyses like under what conditions, the proposed method can achieve smaller sample complexity than existing works.     \n\nOverall this is a strong paper and I recommend to accept.\n \n\n\n"
