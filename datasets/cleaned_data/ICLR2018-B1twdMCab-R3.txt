 "The quality of this paper is good.  The presentation is clear  but I find lack of description of a key topic.  The proposed model is not very innovative but works fine for the DQA task.  For the TE task, the proposed method does not perform better than the state-of-the-art systems.  \n\n- As ESIM is one of the key components in the experiments, you should briefly introduce ESIM and explain how you incorporated with your vector representations into ESIM. \n- The reference of ESIM is not correct. \n- Figure 1 is hard to understand.  \n- What corpus did you use to pre-train word vectors?  \n- As the proposed method was successful for the QA task,  you need to explain QA data sets and how the questions are solved. \n- I also expect performance and  error analysis of the task results.   \n- To claim \"task-agnostic\", you need to try to apply your method to other NLP tasks as well. \n- Page 3. \\Sigma is not defined."
