 "The paper \u2018Deep learning for Physical Process: incorporating prior physical knowledge\u2019 proposes\nto question the use of data-intensive strategies such as deep learning in solving physical \ninverse problems that are traditionally solved through assimilation strategies.  They notably show\nhow physical priors on a given phenomenon can be incorporated in the learning process and propose \nan application on the problem of estimating sea surface temperature directly from a given \ncollection of satellite images. \n\nAll in all the paper is very clear and interesting.  The results obtained on the considered problem \nare clearly of great interest, especially when compared to state-of-the-art assimilation strategies\nsuch as the one of B\u00e9r\u00e9ziat.  While the learning architecture is not original in itself, it is \nshown that a proper physical regularization greatly improves the performance.  For these reasons I \nbelieve the paper has sufficient merits to be published at ICLR.  That being said, I believe that \nsome discussions could strengthen the paper:\n - Most classical variational assimilation schemes are stochastic in nature, notably by incorporating\nuncertainties in the observation or physical evolution models.  It is still unclear how those uncertainties \ncan be integrated in the model ;\n - Assimilation methods are usually independent of the type of data at hand.  It is not clear how the model\nlearnt on one particular type of data transpose to other data sequences.  Notably, the question of transfer\nand generalization is of high relevance here.  Does the learnt model performs well on other dataset (for instance,\nacquired on a different region or at a distant time).  I believe this type of issue has to be examinated \nfor this type of approach to be widely use in inverse physical problems.
