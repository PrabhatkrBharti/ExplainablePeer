 "This paper presents an impressive set of results on predicting lung pathologies from chest x-ray images.  \nAuthors present two architectures: one based on denseNet, and one based on denseNet + LSTM on output dimensions (i.e. similar to NADE model), and compare it to state of the art on the chest x-ray classification.  Experiments are clearly described and results are significantly better compared to state of the art. \n\nThe only issue with this paper is, that their proposed method, in practice is not tractable for inference on estimating probability of a single output, a task which would be critical in medical domain.  Considering that their paper is titled as a work to use \"dependencies\" among labels, not being able to evaluate their network's, and lack of interpretable evaluation results on this model in the experiment section is a major limitation.  \n\nOn the other hand, there are many alternative models where one could simply use multi-task learning and shared parameter, to predict multiple outcomes extremely efficiently.  To be able to claim that this paper improved the prediction by better modeling of 'dependencies' among labels, I would need to see how the (much simpler) multi-task setting works as well.  \n\nThat said, the paper has several positive aspects in all areas:\n\nOriginality - the paper presents first combination of DenseNets with LSTM-based output factorization, \nWriting clarity - the paper is very well written and clear. \nQuality - (apart from the missing multi-task baseline), the results are significantly better than state of the art, and experiments are well done, \nSignificance - Apart from the issue of intractable inference which is arguably a large limitation of this work,
