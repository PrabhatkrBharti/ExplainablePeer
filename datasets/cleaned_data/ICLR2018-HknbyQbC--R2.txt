 "This paper describes AdvGAN, a conditional GAN plus adversarial loss.  AdvGAN is able to generate adversarial samples by running a forward pass on generator.  The authors evaluate AdvGAN on semi-white box and black box setting. \n\nAdvGAN is a simple and neat solution to for generating adversary samples.  The author also reports state-of-art results. \n\nComment:\n\n1. For MNIST samples, we can easily find the generated sample is a mixture of two digitals. Eg, for digital 7 there is a light gray 3 overlap.  I am wondering this method is trying to mixture several samples into one to generate adversary samples.  For real color samples, it is harder to figure out the mixture. \n2. Based on mixture assumption, I suggest the author add one more comparison to other method,  which is relative change from original image, to see whether AdvGAN is the most efficient model to generate the adversary sample (makes minimal change to original image).\n\n\n\n"
