 "This paper provides a survey of attribute-aware collaborative filtering.  In particular, it classifies existing methods into four different categories, according to the representation of the interactions of users, items and attributes.  Furthermore, the authors also provide the probabilistic interpretation of the models.  In addition, preliminary experiments comparing among different categories are also provided.  \n\nThere have existed several works which also provide surveys of attribute-aware collaborative filtering . Hence, the contribution of this paper is limited, although the authors claim two differences between their work and the existing ones.  In particular, the advantages and disadvantages of different categories are not systematically compared, and hence the readers cannot get insightful comments and suggestions from this survey.\ n\nIn general, survey papers are not very suitable for publication at conferences. \n"
