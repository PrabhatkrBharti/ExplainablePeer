 "This paper satisfies the following necessary conditions for\nacceptance.  The writing is clear and I was able to understand the\npresented method (and its motivation) despite not being too familiar\nwith the relevant literature.  Explicitly writing the auto-encoder(s)\nas pseudo-code algorithms was particular helpful.  I found no technical\nerrors.  The problem addressed is one worth solving - building a\ngenerative model of observed data.  There is some empirical testing\nwhich show the presented method in a good light. \n\nThe authors are careful to relate the presented method with existing\nones, most notably VAE and AAE.  I suppose one could argue that the\nclose connection to existing methods means that this paper is not\ninnovative enough.  I think that would be unfair - most new methods\nhave close relations with existing ones - it is just that sometimes\nthe authors do not flag this up as they should. \n\nWAE is a bit oversold.  The authors state that WAE generates \"samples\nof better quality\" (than VAE) without any condition being put on when\nit does this.  There is no proof that it is always better, and I can't\nsee how there could be.  Any method of inferring a generative model\nfrom data must make some 'inductive' assumptions.  Surely one could\ndevise situations where VAE outperforms WAE.  I think this issue should\nhave been examined in more depth. \n\nI found no typo or grammatical errors which is unusual - good careful\njob
