 "This paper introduces siamese neural networks to the competing risks framework of Fine and Gray. The authors optimize for the c-index by minimizing a loss function driven by the cumulative risk of competing risk m and correct ordering of comparable pairs.  While the idea of optimizing directly for the c-index directly is a good one (with an approximation and with useful complementary loss function terms),  the paper leaves something to be desired in quality and clarity. \n\nRelated works:\n- For your consideration: is multi-task survival analysis effectively a competing risks model, except that these models also estimate risk after the first competing event (i.e. in a competing risks model the rates for other events simply go to 0 or near-zero)? Please discuss.  Also, if the claim is that there are not deep learning survival analyses, please see, e.g. Jing and Smola. \n- It would be helpful to define t_k explicitly to alleviate determining whether it is the interval time between ordered events or the absolute time since t_0 (it's the latter).  Consider calling k a time index instead of t_k a time interval (\"subject x experiences cause m occurs [sic] in a time interval t_k\")\n- Line after eq 8: do you mean accuracy term? \n- I would not call Reg a regularization term since it is not shrinking the coefficients . It is a term to minimize a risk not a parameter .\n- You claim to adjust for event imbalance and time interval imbalance but this is not mathematically shown nor documented in the experiments. \n- The results show only one form of comparison, and the results have confidence intervals that overlap with at least one competing method in all tasks."
