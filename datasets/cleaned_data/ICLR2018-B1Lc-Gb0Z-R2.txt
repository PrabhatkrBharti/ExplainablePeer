 "This paper examines the problem of optimizing deep networks of hard-threshold units.  This is a significant topic with implications for quantization for computational efficiency, as well as for exploring the space of learning algorithms for deep networks.  While none of the contributions are especially novel,  the analysis is clear and well-organized, and the authors do a nice job in connecting their analysis to other work. "
