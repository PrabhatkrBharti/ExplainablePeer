 "This paper investigates identity space learning with well-controlled variations using an artistic portraits dataset.  Especially, the authors propose a visual Turing test to evaluate the synthesize quality of three generative models: WGAN-GP, DFC-VAE, and Pixel VAE. \n\nThe submission has following PROS:\n\n+ The proposed visual Turing test provides a novel solution to evaluate the generation quality.  The test not only distinguishes real from synthesized faces but also evaluates the observer ability by determining whether the observer is a human.  This is a merit compared with existing protocols used in generation evaluation.  \n\n+ The generated face images are very impressive, especially the improved 512x512-pixel outputs. \n\n+ The paper presents a promising application in police composite sketching, which can significantly improve human-in-the-loop search in face modeling.  \n\nHowever, the submission also suffers from multiple CONS:\n\n- The novelty of this paper is limited.  The only novelty I can pinpoint is the proposed visual Turing test.  The dataset, as well as all investigated models/approaches, are existing work.  The visual Turing test is interesting but not concrete enough to support an ICLR publication. \n\n- A very small dataset (3,300 subjects and 3,353 images) is used in the whole investigation.  It is doubtful that the conclusion or results obtained in this small dataset could be scaled up to real-world applications or datasets (millions of subjects and images).  It would be favorable to empirically prove this by designing additional experiments. \n\n- Missing details.  \n(a)In section 4, how to use formal method (Ledig et al., 2016) to enlarge the portrait from 64x64 to 512x512 is unclear. \n(b) Lacking details of the model setups and training strategies.  The generation models are usually highly sensitive to details settings.  The readers can hardly reproduce the results or evaluate possible performance by reading the paper.  \n(c) If the paper length is limited, a supplementary material about those details would be preferred. \n\n- Typos.\n(a) Page 7, \"Figure 8 shows the seeds and example images for 10 rounds...\"  \n----> Figure 8 should be Figure 10\n(b) Page 4, \"yet is is unclear how many pixels are required...\"\n----> yet is is"
