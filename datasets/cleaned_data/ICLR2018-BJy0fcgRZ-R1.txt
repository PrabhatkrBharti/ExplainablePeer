 "Quality\n\nThis paper demonstrates that human category representations can be inferred by sampling deep feature spaces.  The idea is an extension of the earlier developed MCMC with people approach where samples are drawn in the latent space of a DCGAN and a BiGAN.  The approach is thoroughly validated using two online behavioural experiments. \n\nClarity\n\nThe rationale is clear and the results are straightforward to interpret.  In Section 4.2.1 statements on resemblance and closeness to mean faces could be tested.  Last sentences on page 7 are hard to parse.  The final sentence probably relates back to the CI approach.  A few typos.\n\nOriginality\n\nThe approach is a straightforward extension of the MCMCP approach using generative models. \n\nSignificance \n\nThe approach improves on previous category estimation approaches by embracing the expressiveness of recent generative models.  Extensive experiments demonstrate the usefulness of the approach. \n\nPros\n\nUseful extension of an important technique backed up by behavioural experiments. \n\nCons\n\nDoes not provide new theory but combines existing ideas in a new manner."
