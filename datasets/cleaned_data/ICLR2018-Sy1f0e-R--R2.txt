 "Thanks for an interesting paper.  \n\nThe paper evaluates popular GAN evaluation metrics to better understand their properties.  The \"novelty\" of this paper is a bit hard to assess.  However, I found their empirical evaluation and experimental observations to be very interesting.  If the authors release their code as promised, the off-the-shelf tool would be a very valuable contribution to the GAN community.  \n\nIn addition to existing metrics, it would be useful to add Frechet Inception Distance (FID) and Multi-scale structural similarity (MS-SSIM).  \n\nHave you considered approximations to Wasserstein distance? E.g. Danihelka et al proposed using an independent Wasserstein critic to evaluate GANs:  \nComparison of Maximum Likelihood and GAN-based training of Real NVPs\nhttps://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.05263.pdf \n\nHow sensitive are the results to hyperparameters?  It would be interesting to see some sensitivity analysis as well as understand the correlations between different metrics for different hyperparameters (cf. Appendix G in https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.04987.pdf) \n\nDo you think it would be useful to compare other generative models (e.g. VAEs) using these evaluation metrics?  Some of the metrics don't capture perceptual similarity, but I'm curious to hear what you think. \n"
