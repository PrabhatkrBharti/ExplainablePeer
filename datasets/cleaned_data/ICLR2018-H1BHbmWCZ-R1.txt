 "The paper is motivated with building robots that learn in an open-ended way, which is really interesting.  What it actually investigates is the performance of existing image classifiers and object detectors.  I could not find any technical contribution or something sufficiently mature and interesting for presenting in ICLR. \n\nSome issues:\n- submission is supposed to be double blind but authors reveal their identity at the start of section 2.1. \n- implementation details all over the place (section 3. is called \"Implementation\", but at that point no concrete idea has been proposed, so it seems too early for talking about tensorflow and keras).
