 "This work proposes an LSTM based model for time-evolving probability densities.  The model does not assume an explicit prior over the underlying dynamical systems, instead only uncertainty over observation noise is explicitly considered.  Experiments results are good for given synthetic scenarios  but less convincing for real data.   \n\nClarity: The paper is well-written.  Some notations in the LSTM section could be better explained for readers who are unfamiliar with LSTMs.  Otherwise, the paper is well-structured and easy to follow.\ n\nOriginality: I'm not familiar with LSTMs, it is hard for me to judge the originality here. \n\nSignificance: Average.  The work would be stronger if the authors can extend this to higher dimensional time series.  There are also many papers on this topic using Gaussian process state-space (GP-SSM) models where an explicit prior is assumed over the underlying dynamical systems.  The authors might want to comment on the relative merits between GP-SSMs and DE-RNNs. \n\nThe SMC algorithm used is a sequential-importance-sampling (SIS) method.  I think it's correct but may not scale well with dimensions."
