 "This paper proposes a deep learning architecture for joint learning of feature representation, a target-task mapping function, and a sample re-weighting function.  Specifically, the method tries to discover feature representations, which are invariance in different domains, by minimizing the re-weighted empirical risk and distributional shift between designs. \nOverall, the paper is well written and organized with good description on the related work, research background, and theoretic proofs.  \n\nThe main contribution can be the idea of learning a sample re-weighting function, which is highly important in domain shift.  However, as stated in the paper, since the causal effect of an intervention T on Y conditioned on X is one of main interests, it is expected to add the related analysis in the experiment section."
