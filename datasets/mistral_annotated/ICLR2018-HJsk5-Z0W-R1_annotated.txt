This paper proposes to improve time complexity of factorization machine.  Unfortunately, the paper's claim that FM's time complexity is quadratic to feature size is wrong.  Specifically, the dot product can be computed as (which is linear to feature size)\n\n(\\sum x_i \\beta_i)^T (\\sum x_i \\beta_i) - \\sum_i x_i^2 beta_i^T beta_i \n\nThe projection of feature group into one embedded space proposed in the paper can be viewed as another form of representing the same model when group equals one.  When the number of feature groups do not equal one, they correspond to field aware factorization machine(FFM)[[CLA-POS],[JUS-POS],[DEP-POS],[FAI-POS],[CON-NEG],[ENG-NEG],[ACC-POS],[CST-NEG],[NOV-NEG],[ETH-NEG]]
