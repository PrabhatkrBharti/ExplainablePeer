This paper proposed a procedure for assessing the performance of GANs by re-considering the key of observation.  And using the procedure to test and improve current version of GANs. It demonstrated some interesting stuff.  \n\nIt is not easy to follow the main idea of the paper.  The paper just told difference stories section by section.  Based on my understanding, the claims are 1) the new formalization of the goal of GAN training and 2) using this test to evaluate the success of GAN algorithms empirically?   I suggested that the author should reform the structure, ignore some unrelated content and make the clear claims about the contributions on the introduction part.   \n\nRegarding the experimental part, it can not make strong support for all the claims.  Figure 2 showed almost similar plots for all the varieties.  Meanwhile, the results are performed on some specific model configurations (like ResNet) and settings. It is difficult to justify whether it can generalize to other cases.  Some of the figures do not have the notations of curvey, making people hard to compare.  \n\nTherefore, I think the current version is not ready to be published. The author can make it stronger and consider next venue[[CLA-POS],[JUS-POS],[DEP-POS],[FAI-POS],[CON-POS],[ENG-NEG],[ACC-POS],[CST-POS],[NOV-POS],[ETH-NEG]]
