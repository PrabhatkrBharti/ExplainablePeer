This work tries to generalize the framework of reward augmented maximum likelihood criterion by introducing the notion of cluster, which represents a set of similar data point, e.g., sentence, according to a metric.  By employing the cluster, this work propose a joint source/target modeling by varying how sampling is performed, e.g., draw independently or conditionally, and how the cluster are constructed, e.g., model-wise or non-model.  Experiments on German/English and Chinese/English show gains over other reinforcement learning methods. \n\nIf my understanding is correct, the motivation is investigate alternative combination of how a cluster is constructed, e.g., sampling and model-based scoring.  However one of the problems of this paper is clarity. \n\n- The notion of cluster is still unclear and it took me long to understand it probably because it might be easily confused with other terminology, e.g., clustering.  Also, cluster-to-cluster might not fit well.  \n\n- It is hard to map System-{ABCD} to the underlying proposed methods described in Table 2.  Also, I feel algorithm 1 is spurious given that it merely switch by systems.  Probably better to introduce branch for key methods, parallel sampling/ translation broadcasting and inadaptive or adaptive model[[CLA-POS],[JUS-POS],[DEP-POS],[FAI-POS],[CON-POS],[ENG-NEG],[ACC-POS],[CST-NEG],[NOV-NEG],[ETH-NEG]]
