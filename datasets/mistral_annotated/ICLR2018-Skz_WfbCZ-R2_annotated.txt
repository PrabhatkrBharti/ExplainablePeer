This paper provides a new generalization bound for feed forward networks based on a PAC-Bayesian analysis.  The generalization bound depends on the spectral norm of the layers and the Frobenius norm of the weights.  The resulting generalization bound is similar (though not comparable) to a recent result of Bartlett et al (2017),  however the technique is different since this submission uses PAC-Bayesian analysis.  The resulting proof is more simple and streamlined compared to that of Bartlett et al (2017). \n\nThe paper is well presented, the result is explained and compared to other results, and the proofs seem correct.  The result is not particularly different from previous ones,  but the different proof technique might be a good enough reason to accept this paper.  \n\n\n\n\nTypos: Several citations are unparenthesized when they should be.  Also, after equation (6) there is a reference command that is not compiled properly.\n\n[[CLA-POS],[JUS-POS],[DEP-POS],[FAI-POS],[CON-POS],[ENG-POS],[ACC-POS],[CST-POS],[NOV-POS],[ETH-NEG]]
