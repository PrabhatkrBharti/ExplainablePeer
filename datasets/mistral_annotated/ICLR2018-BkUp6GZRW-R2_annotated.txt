The paper is well written, and the authors do an admirable job of motivating their primary contributions throughout the early portions of the paper.  Each extension to the Dual Actor-Critic is well motivated and clear in context.  Perhaps the presentation of these extensions could be improved by providing a less formal explanation of what each does in practice; multi-step updates, regularized against MC returns, stochastic mirror descent.  \n\nThe practical implementation section losses some of this clear organization, and could certainly be clarified each part tied into Algorithm 1, and this was itself made less high-level. But these are minor gripes overall. \n\nTurning to the experimental section, I think the authors did a good job of evaluating their approach with the ablation study and comparisons with PPO and TRPO.  There were a few things that jumped out to me that I was surprised by.  The difference in performance for Dual-AC between Figure 1 and Figure 2b is significant, but the only difference seems to be a reduce batch size, is this right?  This suggests a fairly significant sensitivity to this hyperparameter if so. \n\nReproducibility in continuous control is particularly problematic.  Nonetheless, in recent work PPO and TRPO performance on the same set of tasks seem to be substantively different than what the authors get in their experiments.  I'm thinking in particular of:\n\nProximal Policy Optimization Algorithms (Schulman et. al., 2017) \nMulti-Batch Experience Replay for Fast Convergence of Continuous Action Control (Han and Sung, 2017) \n\nIn both these cases the results for PPO and TRPO vary pretty significantly from what we see here, and an important one to look at is the InvertedDoublePendulum-v1 task, which I would think PPO would get closer to 8000, and TRPO not get off the ground.  Part of this could be the notion of an \"iteration\", which was not clear to me how this corresponded to actual time steps.  Most likely, to my mind, is that the parameterization used (discussed in the appendix) is improving TRPO and hurting PPO. \n\nWith these in mind I view the comparison results with a bit of uncertainty about the exact amount of gain being achieved,;  which may beg the question if the algorithmic contributions are buying much for their added complexity? \n\nPros:\nWell written, thorough treatment of the approaches. \nImprovements on top of Dual-AC with ablation study show improvement. \n\nCons:\nEmpirical gains might not be very large[[CLA-POS],[JUS-POS],[DEP-POS],[FAI-POS],[CON-POS],[ENG-POS],[ACC-POS],[CST-POS],[NOV-POS],[ETH-POS]]
