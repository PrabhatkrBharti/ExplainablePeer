This is a very well-written and nicely structured paper that tackles the problem of generating/inferring code given an incomplete description (sketch) of the task to be achieved.  This is a novel contribution to existing machine learning approaches to automated programming that is achieved by training on a large corpus of Android apps.  The combination of the proposed technique and leveraging of real data are a substantial strength of the work compared to many approaches that have come previously. \n\nThis paper has many strengths:\n1) The writing is clear, and the paper is well-motivated\n2)  The proposed algorithm is described in excellent detail, which is essential to reproducibility\n3)  As stated previously, the approach is validated with a large number of real Android projects\n4)  The fact that the language generated is non-trivial (Java-like) is a substantial plus\n5) Good discussion of limitations\n\n Overall, this paper is a valuable addition to the empirical software engineering community, and a nice break from more traditional approaches of learning abstract syntax trees.[[CLA-POS],[JUS-POS],[DEP-POS],[FAI-POS],[CON-NEG],[ENG-POS],[ACC-POS],[CST-NEG],[NOV-POS],[ETH-POS]]
