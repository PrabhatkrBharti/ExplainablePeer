The interesting paper provides theoretical support for the low-dimensional vector embeddings computed using LSTMs or simple techniques, using tools from compressed sensing.   The paper also provides numerical results to support their theoretical findings.   The paper is well presented and organized.  \n\n-In theorem 4.1, the embedding dimension $d$ is depending on $T^2$, and it may scale poorly with respect to $T$.[[CLA-POS],[JUS-POS],[DEP-POS],[FAI-POS],[CON-POS],[ENG-NEG],[ACC-POS],[CST-POS],[NOV-POS],[ETH-NEG]]
