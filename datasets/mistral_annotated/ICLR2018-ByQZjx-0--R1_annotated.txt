In the paper titled \"Faster Discovery of Neural Architectures by Searching for Paths in a Large Model\", the authors proposed an efficient algorithm which can be used for efficient (less resources and time) and faster architecture design for neural networks.  The motivation of the new algorithm is by sharing parameters across child models in the searching of archtecture.  The new algorithm is empirically evaluated on two datasets (CIFAR-10 and Penn Treeback);  --- the new algorithm is 10 times faster and requires only 1/100 resources, and the performance gets worse only slightly. \n\nOverall, the paper is well-written.  Although the methodology within the paper appears to be incremental over previous NAS method, the efficiency got improved quite significantly[[CLA-POS],[JUS-POS],[DEP-NEG],[FAI-POS],[CON-NEG],[ENG-NEG],[ACC-POS],[CST-NEG],[NOV-POS],[ETH-NEG]]
