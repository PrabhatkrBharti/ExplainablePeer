The paper describes a technique to incorporate dialog acts into neural conversational agents.   This is very interesting work.   Existing techniques for neural conversational agents essentially mimic the data in large corpora of message-response pairs and therefore do not use any notion of dialog act.   A very important type of dialog act is \"switching topic\", often done to ensure that the conversation will continue.   The paper describes a classifier that predicts the dialog act of the next utterance.   The next utterance is then generated based on this dialog act.   The paper also describes how to increase the relevance of responses and the length of conversations by self reinforcement learning. This is also very interesting.   The empirical evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of the approach.   The paper is also well written.   I do not have any suggestion for improvement.  This is good work that should be published[[CLA-POS],[JUS-POS],[DEP-NEG],[FAI-POS],[CON-NEG],[ENG-NEG],[ACC-POS],[CST-POS],[NOV-POS],[ETH-NEG]]
