3D data processing is very important topic nowadays, since it has a lot of applications: robotics, AR/VR, etc. \n\nCurrent approaches to 2D image processing based on Deep Neural Networks provide very accurate results and a wide variety of different architectures for image modelling, generation, classification, retrieval. \n\nThe lack of DL architectures for 3D data is due to complexity of representation of 3D data, especially when using 3D point clouds. \n\nConsidered paper is one of the first approaches to learn GAN-type generative models. \nUsing PointNet architecture and latent-space GAN, the authors obtained rather accurate generative model. \n\nThe paper is well written, results of experiments are convincing, the authors provided the code on the github, realizing their architectures.  \n\nThus I think that the paper should be published.[[CLA-POS],[JUS-POS],[DEP-NEG],[FAI-POS],[CON-NEG],[ENG-POS],[ACC-POS],[CST-POS],[NOV-POS],[ETH-POS]]
