It is rather difficult to evaluate the manuscript. A large part of the manuscript reviews various papers from the active vision domain and subsequently proposes that this can directly be modeled using Friston\u2019s free energy principle, essentially, by \u201canalogy\u201d, as the authors state.  This extends up to page 4. I would argue, that this is quite a stretch, as the free energy principle is essentially blind to the idea of rewards and preferable states such that all tasks are essentially evaluated in terms surprise reduction.  The authors furthermore introduce a simplification of the setting, i.e. that nothing changes in a scene during saccadic exploration, which is rather unusual for active vision problems.  \nThe authors provide some detail about the actual implementation of their model, section 4, but the in depth details required at ICLR are missing.  No comparisons to other gaze selection models or saliency models are given.  \nFurthermore, the manuscript seems to suggest, that the simulation results are somehow related to human vision as it is stated:\n\u201cThe model provides apparently realistic saccades, for they cover the full range of the image and tend to point over regions that contain class-characteristic pixels.\u201d\nbut no actual comparisons or evaluations are provided.
