This paper presents a method for clustering based on latent representations learned from the classification of transformed data after pseudo-labellisation corresponding to applied transformation.  Pipeline: -Data are augmented with domain-specific transformations . For instance, in the case of MNIST, rotations with different degrees are applied . All data are then labelled as \"original\" or \"transformed by ...(specific transformation)\". -Classification task is performed with a neural network on augmented dataset according to the pseudo-labels.  -In parallel of the classification, the neural network also learns the latent representation in an unsupervised fashion.  -k-means clustering is performed on the representation space observed in the hidden layer preceding the augmented softmax layer.  \n\nDetailed Comments:\n(*) Pros\n-The method outperforms the state-of-art regarding unsupervised methods for handwritten digits clustering on MNIST. \n-Use of ACOL and GAR is interesting, also the idea to make \"labeled\" data from unlabelled ones by using data augmentation. \n\n(*) Cons\n-minor: in the title, I find the expression \"unsupervised clustering\" uselessly redundant since clustering is by definition unsupervised. \n-Choice of datasets: we already obtained very good accuracy for the classification or clustering of handwritten digits . This is not a very challenging task. \nAnd just because something works on MNIST, does not mean it works in general.  \nWhat are the performances on more challenging datasets like colored images (CIFAR-10, labelMe, ImageNet, etc.)? \n-This is not clear what is novel here since ACOL and GAR already exist.  The novelty seems to be in the adaptation to GAR from the semi-supervised to the unsupervised setting with labels indicating if data have been transformed or not. \n\n\nMy main problem  was about the lack of novelty.  The authors clarified this point, and it turned out that ACOL and GAR have never published elsewhere except in ArXiv .  The other issue concerned the validation of the approach on databases other than MNIST.  The author also addressed this point, and I changed my scores accordingly.
