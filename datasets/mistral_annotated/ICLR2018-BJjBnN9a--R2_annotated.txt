This paper aims to provide a continuous variant of CNN.   The main idea is to apply CNN on Hilbert maps of the data.  The data is mapped to a continuous Hilbert space via a reproducing kernel and a convolution layer is defined using the kernel matrix.  A convolutional Hilbert layer algorithm is introduced and evaluated on image classification data sets. \n\nThe paper is well written and provides some new insights on incorporating kernels in CNN. \n\nThe kernel matrix in Eq. 5 is not symmetric and the kernel function in Eq. 3 is not defined over a pair of inputs.  In this case, the projections of the data via the kernel are not necessarily in a RKHS.  The connection between Hilbert maps and RKHS in that sense is not clear in the paper. \n\nThe size of a kernel matrix depends on the sample size.  In large scale situations, working with the kernel matrix can be computational expensive.  It is not clear how this issue is addressed in this paper. \n\nIn section 2.2, how \\mu_i and \\sigma_i are computed? \n\nHow the proposed approach can be compared to convolutional kernel networks (NIPS paper) of Mairal et al. (2014)?[[CLA-POS],[JUS-POS],[DEP-POS],[FAI-POS],[CON-POS],[ENG-POS],[ACC-POS],[CST-POS],[NOV-POS],[ETH-NEG]]
