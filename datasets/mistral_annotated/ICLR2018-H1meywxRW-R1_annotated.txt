Summary:\nThis paper proposed an extension of the dynamic coattention network (DCN) with deeper residual layers and self-attention.  It also introduced a mixed objective with self-critical policy learning to encourage predictions with high word overlap with the gold answer span.  The resulting DCN+ model achieved significant improvement over DCN. \n\nStrengths:\nThe model and the mixed objective is well-motivated and clearly explained.\nNear state-of-the-art performance on SQuAD dataset (according to the SQuAD leaderboard). \n\nOther questions and comments:\nThe ablation shows 0.7 improvement on EM with mixed objective.  It is interesting that the mixed objective (which targets F1) also brings improvement on EM. \n[[CLA-POS],[JUS-POS],[DEP-NEG],[FAI-POS],[CON-NEG],[ENG-NEG],[ACC-POS],[CST-NEG],[NOV-POS],[ETH-NEG]]
