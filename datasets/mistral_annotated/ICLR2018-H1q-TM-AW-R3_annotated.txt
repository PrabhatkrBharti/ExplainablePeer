The paper was a good contribution to domain adaptation. It provided a new way of looking at the problem by using the cluster assumption.  The experimental evaluation was very thorough and shows that VADA and DIRT-T performs really well.  \n\nI found the math to be a bit problematic. For example, L_d in (4) involves a max operator. Although I understand what the authors mean, I don't think this is the correct way to write this. (5) should discuss the min-max objective.  This will probably involve an explanation of the gradient reversal etc. Speaking of GRL, it's mentioned on p.6 that they replaced GRL with the traditional GAN objective.  This is actually pretty important to discuss in detail: did that change the symmetric nature of domain-adversarial training to the asymmetric nature of traditional GAN training? Why was that important to the authors? \n\nThe literature review could also include Shrivastava et al. and Bousmalis et al. from CVPR 2017. The latter also had MNIST/MNIST-M experiments.[[CLA-POS],[JUS-POS],[DEP-POS],[FAI-POS],[CON-POS],[ENG-POS],[ACC-POS],[CST-NEG],[NOV-POS],[ETH-NEG]]
