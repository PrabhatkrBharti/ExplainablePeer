In this paper, the authors show how a Deep Learning model for sea surface temperature prediction can be designed to incorporate the classical advection diffusion model.  The architecture includes a differentiable warping scheme which allows back propagation of the error and is inspired by the fundamental solution of the PDE model.  They evaluate the suggested model on synthetic data and outperform the current state of the art in terms of accuracy. \n\npros\n- the paper is written in a clear and concise manner \n- it suggests an interesting connection between a traditional model and Deep Learning techniques\ n- in the experiments they trained the network on 64 x 64 patches and achieved convincing results \n\ncons\n- please provide the value of the diffusion coefficient for the sake of reproducibility \n- medium resolution of the resulting prediction \n\n\nI enjoyed reading this paper and would like it to be accepted. \n\nminor comments:\n- on page five in the last paragraph there is a left parenthesis missing in the inline formula nabla dot w_t(x))^2. \n- on page nine in the last paragraph there is the word 'flow' missing: '.. estimating the optical [!] between 2 [!] images.' \n- in the introduction (page two) the authors refer to SST prediction as a 'relatively complex physical modeling problem', whereas in the conclusion (page ten) it is referred to as 'a problem of intermediate complexity'. This seems to be inconsistent.[[CLA-POS],[JUS-POS],[DEP-POS],[FAI-POS],[CON-POS],[ENG-NEG],[ACC-POS],[CST-POS],[NOV-POS],[ETH-POS]]
