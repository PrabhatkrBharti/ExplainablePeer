This paper made some efforts in smoothing the top-k losses proposed in Lapin et al. (2015).   A family of smooth surrogate loss es was proposed, with the help of which the top-k error may be minimized directly.  The properties of the smooth surrogate losses were studied and the computational algorithms for SVM with these losses function were also proposed.  \n\nPros:\n1, The paper is well presented and is easy to follow. \n2, The contribution made in this paper is sound, and the mathematical analysis seems to be correct.  \n3, The experimental results look convincing.  \n\nCons:\nSome statements in this paper are not clear to me.  For example, the authors mentioned sparse or non-sparse loss functions.  This statement, in my view, could be misleading without further explanation (the non-sparse loss was mentioned in the abstract)[[CLA-POS],[JUS-POS],[DEP-POS],[FAI-POS],[CON-NEG],[ENG-NEG],[ACC-POS],[CST-POS],[NOV-POS],[ETH-NEG]]
