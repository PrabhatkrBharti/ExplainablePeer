This work proposes a variation of the DenseNet architecture that can cope with computational resource limits at test time.  The paper is very well written, experiments are clearly presented and convincing and, most importantly, the research question is exciting (and often overlooked).  \n\nMy only major concern is the degree of technical novelty with respect to the original DenseNet paper of Huang et al. (2017).  The authors add a hierarchical, multi-scale structure and show that DenseNet can better cope with it than ResNet (e.g., Fig. 3).  They investigate pros and cons in detail adding more valuable analysis in the appendix.  However, this work is basically an extension of the DenseNet approach with a new problem statement and additional, in-depth analysis.    \n\nSome more minor comments: \n\n-\tPlease enlarge Fig. 4.  \n-\tI did not fully grasp the details in the first \"Solution\" paragraph on P5.  Please extend and describe in more detail.  \n\nIn conclusion, this is a very well written paper that designs the network architecture (of DenseNet) such that it is optimized to include CPU budgets at test time.
