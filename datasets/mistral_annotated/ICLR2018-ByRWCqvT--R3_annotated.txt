pros:\nThis is a great paper - I enjoyed reading it.  The authors lay down a general method for addressing various transfer learning problems: transferring across domains and tasks and in a unsupervised fashion.  The paper is clearly written and easy to understand . Even though the method combines the previous general learning frameworks, the proposed algorithm for  LEARNABLE CLUSTERING OBJECTIVE (LCO) is novel, and fits very well in this framework.   Experimental evaluation is performed on several benchmark datasets - the proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art for specific tasks in most cases.  \n\ncons/suggestions: \n- the authors should discuss in more detail the limitations of their approach: it is clear that when there is a high discrepancy between source and target domains, that the similarity prediction network can fail[[CLA-POS],[JUS-POS],[DEP-POS],[FAI-POS],[CON-POS],[ENG-NEG],[ACC-POS],[CST-POS],[NOV-POS],[ETH-NEG]]
