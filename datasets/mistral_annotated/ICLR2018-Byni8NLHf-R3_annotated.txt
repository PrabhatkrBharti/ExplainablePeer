This submission does not fit ICLR .  \n\n- The center topic does not fit ICLR . The main novelty is about using word pair embedding to improve the Topic model . The word-pair was generated by the Standford dependency parser . \n\n- Many citation errors exist \n\n- No clear novelty \n\n- The experimental setup is problematic . The authors filtered the number of words and word-pairs to very small . It is hard to justify any of the results after these strategies . \n\n- The baselines are not thorough and lack proper justifications . \n\n- The experimental results are not properly presented, with many overlapping figures . No insights can be derived from the presented results[[CLA-POS],[JUS-POS],[DEP-POS],[FAI-POS],[CON-NEG],[ENG-NEG],[ACC-POS],[CST-POS],[NOV-POS],[ETH-POS]]
