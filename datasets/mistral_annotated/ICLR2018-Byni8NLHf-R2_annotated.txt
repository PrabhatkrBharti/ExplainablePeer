This paper applies the word pairs, instead to bag of words, to current RBM models . The word pairs are extracted using Stanford parser . The word pairs are further filtered and clustered to improve the representation . The experiments show improvement over baselines. \n\nHowever, I think this paper has limited contribution and novelty,  and the experiments also need to be improved . The detailed comments are as follows:\n\n- The main contribution of this paper is to apply word pairs instead of words to RBM models . However, the main techniques such as RBM, parser to extract word pairs, tf-idf for filtering, and k-means for clustering, are all existing standard techniques.  It is more like an application of these methods, and has limited contribution and novelty. \n\n- For experiments, they apply k-means clustering in the process so k is one parameter to tune. K needs to be tuned on validation set instead of testing set.   This paper simply presents the results of different parameter k on testing set directly. \n\n- The structure of Section 3 needs to be improved.  Instead of listing each step in each subsection, a general introduction picture should be introduced first. More intuition is also needed for each step. .\n\n- The format of reference should be fixed in this paper.[[CLA-POS],[JUS-POS],[DEP-POS],[FAI-POS],[CON-POS],[ENG-NEG],[ACC-POS],[CST-POS],[NOV-POS],[ETH-NEG]]
