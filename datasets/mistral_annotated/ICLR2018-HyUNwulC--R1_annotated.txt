This paper focuses on accelerating RNN by applying the method from Blelloch (1990).  The application is straightforward and thus technical novelty of this paper is limited.  But the results are impressive.  \n\nOne concern is the proposed technique is only applied for few types of RNNs which may limit its applications in practice.  Could the authors comment on this potential limitation[[CLA-POS],[JUS-POS],[DEP-POS],[FAI-POS],[CON-POS],[ENG-NEG],[ACC-POS],[CST-POS],[NOV-POS],[ETH-NEG]]
