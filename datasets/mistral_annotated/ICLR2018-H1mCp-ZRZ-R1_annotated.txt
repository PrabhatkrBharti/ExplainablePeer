In this work, the authors suggest the use of control variate schemes for estimating gradient values, within a reinforcement learning  framework.  The authors also introduce a specific control variate technique based on the so-called Stein\u2019s identity.  The paper is interesting and well-written. \n\nI have some question and some consideration that can be useful for improving the appealing of the paper. \n\n- I believe that different Monte Carlo (or Quasi-Monte Carlo) strategies can be applied in order to estimate the integral (expected value) in Eq. (1), as also suggested in this work.  Are there other alternatives in the literature?  Please, please discuss and cite some papers if required.   \n\n- I suggest to divide Section 3.1 in two subsections. The first one introducing Stein\u2019s identity and the related comments that you need, and a second one, starting after Theorem 3.1, with title \u201cStein Control Variate\u201d. \n\n-  Please also discuss the relationships, connections, and possible applications of your technique to other algorithms used in Bayesian optimization, active learning and/or sequential learning, for instance as\n\nM.
