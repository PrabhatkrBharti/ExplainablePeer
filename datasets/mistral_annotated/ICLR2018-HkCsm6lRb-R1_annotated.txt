The authors propose a generative method that can produce images along a hierarchy of specificity, i.e. both when all relevant attributes are specified,  and when some are left undefined, creating a more abstract generation task.  \n\nPros:\n+ The results demonstrating the method's ability to generate results for (1) abstract and (2) novel/unseen attribute descriptions, are generally convincing . Both quantitative and qualitative results are provided.  \n+ The paper is fairly clea r.\n\nCons:\n- It is unclear how to judge diversity qualitatively, e.g. in Fig. 4(b) .\n- Fig. 5 could be more convincing; \"bushy eyebrows\" is a difficult attribute to judge , and in the abstract generation when that is the only attribute specified, it is not clear how good the results are.\n[[CLA-POS],[JUS-POS],[DEP-POS],[FAI-POS],[CON-NEG],[ENG-NEG],[ACC-POS],[CST-POS],[NOV-POS],[ETH-NEG]]
