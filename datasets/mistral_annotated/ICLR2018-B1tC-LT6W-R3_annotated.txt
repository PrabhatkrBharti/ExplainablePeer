Paper is well written and clearly explained.  The paper is a experimental paper as it has more content on the experimentation  and less content on problem definition and formulation.  The experimental section is strong and it has evaluated across different datasets and various scenarios.  However, I feel the contribution of the paper toward the topic is incremental and not significant enough to be accepted in this venue.  It only considers a slight modification into the loss function by adding a trace norm regularization.[[CLA-POS],[JUS-POS],[DEP-POS],[FAI-POS],[CON-NEG],[ENG-NEG],[ACC-POS],[CST-POS],[NOV-POS],[ETH-NEG]]
