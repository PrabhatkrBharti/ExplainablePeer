This paper extends a previously proposed monotonic alignment based attention mechanism by considering local soft alignment across features in a chunk (certain window).   \n\nPros.\n- the paper is clearly written.\ n- the proposed method is applied to several sequence-to-sequence benchmarks, and the paper show the effectiveness of the proposed method (comparable to full attention and better than previous hard monotonic assignments) .\nCons.\n- in terms of the originality, the methodology of this method is rather incremental from the prior study (Raffel et al),  but it shows significant gains from it. \n- in terms of considering a monotonic alignment, Hori et al, \"Advances in Joint CTC-Attention based End-to-End Speech Recognition with a Deep CNN Encoder and RNN-LM, \" in Interspeech'17, also tries to solve this issue by combining CTC and attention-based methods.  The paper should also discuss this method in Section 4.\ n\nComments:\n- Eq. (16): $j$ in the denominator should be $t_j$.\n[[CLA-POS],[JUS-POS],[DEP-POS],[FAI-POS],[CON-POS],[ENG-POS],[ACC-POS],[CST-POS],[NOV-POS],[ETH-NEG]]
