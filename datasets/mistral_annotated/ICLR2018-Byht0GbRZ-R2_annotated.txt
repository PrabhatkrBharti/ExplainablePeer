This paper proposes a model of \"structured alignments\" between sentences as a means of comparing two sentences by matching their latent structures.  Overall, this paper seems a straightforward application of the model first proposed by Kim et al. 2017 with latent tree attention .\n\nIn section 3.1, the formula for p(c|x) looks wrong: c_{ijk} are indicator variables.  but where are the scores for each span?  I think it should be c_{ijk} * \\delta_{ijk} under the summations instead. \n\nIn the same section, the expression for \\alpha_{ij} seems to assume that \\delta_{ijk} = \\dlta_{ij} regardless of k. I.e. there are no production rule scores (transitions).  This seems rather limiting, can you comment on that? \n\nIn the answer selection and NLI experiments, the proposed model does not beat the SOTA, and is only marginally better than unstructured decomposable attention. This is rather disappointing.  \n\nThe plots in Fig 2 with the marginals on CKY charts are not very enlightening.  How do this marginals help solving the NLI task? \n\nMinor comments:\n- Sec. 3: \"Language is inherently tree structured\" -- this is debatable... \n- page 8: (laf, 2008): bad formatted reference[[CLA-POS],[JUS-POS],[DEP-POS],[FAI-POS],[CON-POS],[ENG-POS],[ACC-POS],[CST-POS],[NOV-POS],[ETH-NEG]]
