The paper proposed a subgraph image representation and validate it in image classification and transfer learning problems.  The image presentation is a minor extension based on a method of producing permutation-invariant adjacency matrix.  The experimental results supports the claim. \n\nIt is very positive that the figures are very helpful for delivering the information. \n\nThe work seems to be a little bit incremental.  The proposed image representation is mainly based on a previous work of permutation-invariant adjacency matrix.  A novelty of this work seems to be transforming a graph into an image.  \n\nIt will be better if the authors could provide more details in the methodology or framework section. \n\nThe experiments on 9 networks support the claims that the image embedding approaches with their image representation of the subgraph outperform the graph kernel and classical features based methods.  It seem to be promising when using transfer learning.  No caption or figure number is provided. \n\nIt will be better to make the notations easy to understand and avoid any notation in a sentence without explanation nearby. \nFor example:\n\"the test example is correctly classified if and only if its ground truth matches C.\"(P5) \n\"We carry out this exercise 4 times and set n to 8, 16, 32 and 64 respectively. \"(P6)\n\nSome minor issues:\n\"Zhu et al.(2011) discuss heterogeneous transfer learning where in they use...\"(P3)\n\"Each label vector (a tuple of label, label-probability pairs).\" (incomplete sentence?P5)[[CLA-POS],[JUS-POS],[DEP-POS],[FAI-POS],[CON-POS],[ENG-POS],[ACC-POS],[CST-POS],[NOV-POS],[ETH-NEG]]
