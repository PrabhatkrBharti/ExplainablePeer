Pros:\n1. A new DNA structure GAN is utilized to manipulate/disentangle attributes. \n\n2. Non attribute part (Z) is explicitly modeled in the framework. \n\n3. Based on the experiment results, this proposed method outperformed previous methods (TD-GAN, IcGAN). \n\nCons:\n1. It assumes that each individual piece represents an independent factor of variation, which can not hold all the time.  The authors also admit that when two factors are dependent, this method might fail. \n\n2. In Lreconstruct, only min difference between A and A1 is considered.  How about A and A2 here?  It seems that A2 should also be similar with A since only one bit in A2 and A1 is different. \n\n3. Only one attribute can be \"manipulated\" each time?  Is it possible to change more than one attribute each time in this method?[[CLA-POS],[JUS-POS],[DEP-POS],[FAI-POS],[CON-POS],[ENG-NEG],[ACC-POS],[CST-POS],[NOV-POS],[ETH-NEG]]
