The topic is interesting however the description in the paper is lacking clarity.  The paper is written in a procedural fashion - I first did that, then I did that and after that I did third.  Having proper mathematical description and good diagrams of what you doing would have immensely helped.  Another big issue is the lack of proper validation in Section 3.4.  Even if you do not know what metric to use to objectively compare your approach versus baseline there are plenty of fields suffering from a similar problem yet  doing subjective evaluations, such as listening tests in speech synthesis.  Given that I see only one example I can not objectively know if your model produces examples like that 'each' time so having just one example is as good as having none.
