This paper misses the point of what VAEs (or GANs, in general) are used for.  The idea of using VAEs is not to encode and decode images (or in general any input), but to recover the generating process that created those images so we have an unlimited source of samples.  The use of these techniques for compressing is still unclear and their quality today is too low.  So the attack that the authors are proposing does not make sense and my take is that we should see significant changes before they can make sense.  \n\nBut let\u2019s assume that at some point they can be used as the authors propose.  In which one person encodes an image, send the latent variable to a friend, but a foe intercepts it on the way and tampers with it so the receiver recovers the wrong image without knowing.  Now if the sender believes the sample can be tampered with, if the sender codes z with his private key would not make the attack useless?  I think this will make the first attack useless.  \n\nThe other two attacks require that the foe is inserted in the middle of the training of the VAE.  This is even less doable, because the encoder and decoder are not train remotely.  They are train of the same machine or cluster in a controlled manner by the person that would use the system.  Once it is train it will give away the decoder and keep the encoder for sending information.\n\n[[CLA-POS],[JUS-POS],[DEP-POS],[FAI-POS],[CON-NEG],[ENG-NEG],[ACC-POS],[CST-POS],[NOV-NEG],[ETH-NEG]]
