The authors proposed a supervised learning algorithm for modeling label and worker quality.  Further utilize it to study one of the important problems in crowdsourcing - How much redundancy is required in crowdsourcing and whether low redundancy with abundant noise examples lead to better labels. \n\nOverall the paper was well written.  The motivation of the work is clearly explained and supported with relevant related work.  The main contribution of the paper is in the bootstrapping algorithm which models the worker quality and labels in an iterative fashion.  Though limited to binary classification, the paper proposed a theoretical framework extending the existing work on VC dimension to compute the upper bound on the risk.  The authors also showed theoretically and empirically on synthetic data sets that the low redundancy and larger set of labels in crowdsourcing gives better results.  \n\nMore detailed comments\n1. Instead of considering multi-class classification as one-vs-all binary classification, can you extend the theoretical guarantee on the risk to multi-class set up like Softmax which is widely used in research nowadays. \n2. Can you introduce the Risk -R in the paper before using it in Theorem 4.1\n3 . Is there any limit on how many examples each worker has to label?  Can you comment more on how to pick that value in real-world settings? Just saying sufficiently many (Section 4.2) is not sufficient. \n4. Under the experiments, different variations of Majority Vote, EM and Oracle correction were used as baselines.  Can you cite the references and also add some existing state-of-the-art techniques mentioned in the related work section. \n5. For the experiments on synthetic datasets, workers are randomly sampled with replacements. Were the scores reported based on average of multiple runs.  If yes, can you please report the error bars. \n6. For the MS-COCO, examples can you provide more detailed results as shown for synthetic datasets? Majority vote is a very weak baseline.  \n\nFor the novel approach and the theoretical backing, I consider the paper to be a good one.  The paper has scope for improvement[[CLA-POS],[JUS-POS],[DEP-POS],[FAI-POS],[CON-POS],[ENG-POS],[ACC-POS],[CST-POS],[NOV-POS],[ETH-NEG]]
