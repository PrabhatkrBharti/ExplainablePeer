The paper intends to show that complex and real valued neural network are different and lead to different results on similar tasks, the complex valued network being more appropriate to 'difficult' problems and datasets. \nThe work seems to have been written in a rush leading to a big number of typos and quickly filled experiment tables (7 and 8 are full of zeros ?).  The only valid conclusion is that real and complex valued neural network cannot be directly compared using the same number of parameters.  Some theoretical aspect or at least some intuition should be more in depth detailed to understand when one should be better than the other. \n\nConcerning the novelty the paper is in the same spirit as https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.09792 but with weaker experiments, theoretical justifications and no valid conclusion[[CLA-POS],[JUS-POS],[DEP-POS],[FAI-POS],[CON-POS],[ENG-POS],[ACC-POS],[CST-POS],[NOV-POS],[ETH-NEG]]
