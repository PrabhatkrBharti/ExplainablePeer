Strengths:\n\n-\tThere is an interesting analysis on how CNN\u2019s perform better Spatial-Relation problems in contrast to Same-Different problems, and how Spatial-Relation problems are less sensitive to hyper parameters. \n\n-\tThe authors bring a good point on the limitations of the SVRT dataset \u2013 mainly being the difficulty to compare visual relations due to the difference of image structures on the different relational tasks and the use of simple closed curves to characterize the relations, which make it difficult to quantify the effect of image variability on the task.  And propose a challenge that addresses these issues and allows controlling different aspects of image variability. \n\n-\tThe paper shows how state of the art relational networks, performing well on multiple relational tasks, fail to generalize to same-ness relationships, \n\nWeaknesses:\n\n-\tWhile the proposed PSVRT dataset addresses the 2 noted problems in SVRT, using only 2 relations in the study is very limited. \n\n-\tThe paper describes two sets of relationships, but it soon suggests that current approaches actually struggle in Same-Different relationships.  However, they only explore this relationship under identical objects.  It would have been interesting to study more kinds of such relationships, such as equality up to translation or rotation, to understand the limitation of such networks.  Would that allow improving generalization to varying item or image sizes? \n\nComments:\n\n-\tIn page 2, authors suggest that from that G\u00fcl\u00e7ehre, Bengio (2013) that for visual relations \u201cfailure of feed-forward networks [\u2026] reflects a poor choice of hyper parameters.  This seems to contradict the later discussion, where they suggest that probably current architectures cannot handle such visual relationships.  \n\n-\tThe point brought about CNN\u2019s failing to generalize on same-ness relationships on sort-of-CLEVR is interesting, but it would be good to know why PSVRT provides better generalization.  What would happen if shapes different than random squared patterns were used at test time? \n\n-\tAuthors reason about biological inspired approaches, using Attention and Memory, based on existing literature.  While they provide some good references to support this statement it would have been interesting to show whether they actually improve TTA under image parameter variations\n[[CLA-POS],[JUS-POS],[DEP-POS],[FAI-POS],[CON-POS],[ENG-NEG],[ACC-POS],[CST-POS],[NOV-POS],[ETH-NEG]]
