The authors introduce an algorithm in the subfield of conditional program generation that is able to create programs in a rich java like programming language.  In this setting, they propose an algorithm based on sketches- abstractions of programs that capture the structure but discard program specific information that is not generalizable such as variable names.  Conditioned on information such as type specification or keywords of a method they generate the method's body from the trained sketches.  \n\u00a0\nPositives:\n\u00a0\n\t\u2022\tNovel algorithm and addition of rich java like language in subfield of 'conditional program generation' proposed\n\t\u2022\tVery good abstract:  It explains high level overview of topic and sets it into context plus gives a sketch of the algorithm and presents the positive results. \n\t\u2022\tExcellently structured and presented paper\n\u00a0\n\t\u2022\t  Motivation given in form of relevant applications and mention that it is relatively unstudied\n\t\u2022\t The hypothesis/ the papers goal is clearly stated.  It is introduced with 'We ask' followed by two well formulated lines that make up the hypothesis.  It is repeated multiple times throughout the paper.  Every mention introduces either a new argument on why this is necessary or sets it in contrast to other learners, clearly stating discrepancies. \n\t\u2022\tExplanations are exceptionally well done: terms that might not be familiar to the reader are explained.  This is true for mathematical aspects as well as program generating specific terms . Examples are given where appropriate in a clear and coherent manner\n\t\u2022\t Problem statement well defined mathematically and understandable for a broad audience\n\t\u2022\t Mentioning of failures and limitations demonstrates a realistic  view on the project\n\t\u2022\t Complexity and time analysis provided\n\t\u2022\t Paper written so that it's easy for a reader to implement the methods\n\t\u2022\t Detailed descriptions of all instantiations even parameters and comparison methods\n\t\u2022\tSystem specified\n\t\u2022\tValidation method specified\n\t\u2022\tData and repository,  as well as cleaning process provided\n\t\u2022\tEvery figure and plot is well explained and interpreted\n\t\u2022\t Large successful evaluation section provided\n\t\u2022\t Many different evaluation measures defined to measure different properties of the project\n\t\u2022\t Different observability modes\n\t\u2022\tEvaluation against most compatible methods from other sources \n\t\u2022\t  Results are in line with hypothesis\n\t\u2022\tThorough appendix clearing any open questions \n\u00a0\n It would have been good to have a summary/conclusion/future work section\n\u00a0\nSUMMARY: ACCEPT.   The authors present a very intriguing novel approach that  in a clear and coherent way.  The approach is thoroughly explained for a large audience. The task itself is interesting and novel.  The large evaluation section that discusses many different properties is a further indication that this approach is not only novel but also very promising.  Even though no conclusive section is provided,  the paper is not missing any information.\n[[CLA-POS],[JUS-POS],[DEP-POS],[FAI-POS],[CON-POS],[ENG-NEG],[ACC-POS],[CST-POS],[NOV-POS],[ETH-POS]]
