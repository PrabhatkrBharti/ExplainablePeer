 "The paper is relatively clear to follow, and implement.[[OAL-POS], [CLA-POS]]  \n\nThe main concern is that this looks like a class project rather than a scientific paper.[[OAL-NEU], [APR-NEU]]  For a class project this could get an A in a ML class![[OAL-NEU], [CNT]] \n\nIn particular, the authors take an already existing dataset, design a trivial convolutional neural network, and report results on it.[[DAT-NEU,MET-NEU,RES-NEU], [null]]  There is absolutely nothing of interest to ICLR except for the fact that now we know that a trivial network is capable of obtaining 90% accuracy on this dataset."[[DAT-NEU,MET-NEU,RES-NEU], [APR-NEG,EMP-NEU]]
