 "Paper summary:\nThis paper proposes a technique to generalize deconvolution operations used in standard CNN architectures.[[INT-NEU], [null]]  Traditional deconvolution operation uses independent filter weights to compute output features at adjacent pixels.[[PDI-NEU], [null]]  This work proposes to do sequential prediction of adjacent pixel features (via intermediate feature maps) resulting in more spatially smooth outputs for deconvolution layer.[[PDI-NEU], [null]]  This new layer is referred to as \u2018pixel deconvolution layer\u2019 and it is demonstrated on two tasks of semantic segmentation and face generation.[[PDI-NEU], [null]] \n\n\nPaper Strengths:\n- Despite being simple technique, the proposed pixel deconvolution layer is novel and interesting.[[MET-POS], [NOV-POS,EMP-POS]]
