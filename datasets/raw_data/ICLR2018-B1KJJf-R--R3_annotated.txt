 "This paper introduces a technique for program synthesis involving a restricted grammar of problems that is beam-searched using an attentional encoder-decoder network.[[INT-NEU,PDI-NEU], [null]]  This work to my knowledge is the first to use a DSL closer to a full language.[[MET-POS], [EMP-POS]] \n\nThe paper is very clear and easy to follow.[[OAL-POS], [CLA-POS,PNF-POS]]  One way it could be improved is if it were compared with another system.[[RWK-NEG,OAL-NEG], [CMP-NEG]]  The results showing that guided search is a potent combination whose contribution would be made only stronger if compared with existing work."[[RWK-NEU,RES-NEU], [EMP-NEU]]
