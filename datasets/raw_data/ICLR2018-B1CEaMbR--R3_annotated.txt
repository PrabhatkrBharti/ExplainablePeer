 "The paper is mostly a survey about clustering methods with neural networks.[[INT-NEU,PDI-NEU], [null]]  \n\nSection 2 presents a taxonomy for the different neural network clustering methods.[[MET-NEU], [null]]  A rich lists of the possible components of the neural network-based clustering methods are given, that include the different neural network architectures, feature to use for clustering, loss functions used and more.[[MET-NEU], [null]]  In Section 3, a few methods from the literature are classified according to the proposed taxonomy.[[MET-NEU], [null]]  Furthermore, in Section 4 a new method is proposed, that is to combine the best parts of the already existing models in the literature.[[RWK-NEU,MET-NEU], [CMP-NEU,EMP-NEU]]  Unfortunately, the experiments is Section 5 reveal that the proposed method yields results that are at most comparable with the existing methods.[[RWK-NEG,EXP-NEG,MET-NEG,RES-NEG], [CMP-NEG]]  \n\nThe paper is written well and provides good insights (mostly taxonomy) on the existing methods for neural network-based clustering.[[RWK-POS,RES-POS,OAL-POS], [CLA-POS,CMP-POS]]  However, the paper lacks novel content.[[OAL-NEG], [NOV-NEG]]  The novel content of the paper sums up to the proposed method, that is composed of building blocks of existing models, and fails to impress in experimental results.[[EXP-NEG,MET-NEG,RES-NEG], [EMP-NEG]]  It could be that this paper belongs to another venue that is more appropriate for survey papers.[[OAL-NEG], [APR-NEG,REC-NEG]]   Also, it overall rather appears short.\n"[[OAL-NEG], [APR-NEG,SUB-NEG]]
