 "This submission does not fit ICLR[[OAL-NEG], [REC-NEG]] .  \n\n- The center topic does not fit ICLR[[PDI-NEG], [APR-NEG]] . The main novelty is about using word pair embedding to improve the Topic model[[PDI-NEU], [NOV-NEU]] . The word-pair was generated by the Standford dependency parser[[DAT-NEU,MET-NEU], [NULL]] . \n\n- Many citation errors exist[[BIB-NEG], [null]] \n\n- No clear novelty[[PDI-NEG], [NOV-NEG]] \n\n- The experimental setup is problematic[[EXP-NEG], [EMP-NEG]] . The authors filtered the number of words and word-pairs to very small[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU]] . It is hard to justify any of the results after these strategies[[RES-NEG], [NULL]] . \n\n- The baselines are not thorough and lack proper justifications[[RWK-NEG], [SUB-NEG]] . \n\n- The experimental results are not properly presented, with many overlapping figures[[EXP-NEU,RES-NEU,TNF-NEG], [PNF-NEG]] . No insights can be derived from the presented results.[[RES-NEG,ANA-NEG], [EMP-NEG]]
