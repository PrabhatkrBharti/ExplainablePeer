 "This paper aims to provide a continuous variant of CNN.[[INT-NEU], [null]]   The main idea is to apply CNN on Hilbert maps of the data.[[PDI-NEU], [null]]  The data is mapped to a continuous Hilbert space via a reproducing kernel and a convolution layer is defined using the kernel matrix.[[PDI-NEU], [null]]  A convolutional Hilbert layer algorithm is introduced and evaluated on image classification data sets.[[DAT-NEU,MET-NEU], [null]] \n\nThe paper is well written and provides some new insights on incorporating kernels in CNN.[[MET-POS,OAL-POS], [CLA-POS,NOV-POS]] \n\nThe kernel matrix in Eq. 5 is not symmetric and the kernel function in Eq. 3 is not defined over a pair of inputs.[[MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG]]  In this case, the projections of the data via the kernel are not necessarily in a RKHS.[[MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG]]  The connection between Hilbert maps and RKHS in that sense is not clear in the paper.[[MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG]] \n\nThe size of a kernel matrix depends on the sample size.[[DAT-NEU,MET-NEU], [null]]  In large scale situations, working with the kernel matrix can be computational expensive.[[MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG]]  It is not clear how this issue is addressed in this paper.[[MET-NEG], [SUB-NEG]] \n\nIn section 2.2, how \\mu_i and \\sigma_i are computed?[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU]] \n\nHow the proposed approach can be compared to convolutional kernel networks (NIPS paper) of Mairal et al. (2014)?"[[RWK-NEU,MET-NEU], [CMP-NEU]]
