 "This paper provides a survey of attribute-aware collaborative filtering.[[INT-NEU,PDI-NEU], [null]]  In particular, it classifies existing methods into four different categories, according to the representation of the interactions of users, items and attributes.[[RWK-NEU,MET-NEU], [CMP-NEU]]  Furthermore, the authors also provide the probabilistic interpretation of the models.[[MET-NEU], [null]]  In addition, preliminary experiments comparing among different categories are also provided. [[EXP-NEU], [null]] \n\nThere have existed several works which also provide surveys of attribute-aware collaborative filtering[[RWK-NEU,EXT-NEU], [CMP-NEU]] . Hence, the contribution of this paper is limited, although the authors claim two differences between their work and the existing ones.[[OAL-NEG], [SUB-NEG,CMP-NEG]]  In particular, the advantages and disadvantages of different categories are not systematically compared, and hence the readers cannot get insightful comments and suggestions from this survey.\[[RES-NEG], [EMP-NEG]] n\nIn general, survey papers are not very suitable for publication at conferences. \n"[[EXT-NEG], [APR-NEG]]
