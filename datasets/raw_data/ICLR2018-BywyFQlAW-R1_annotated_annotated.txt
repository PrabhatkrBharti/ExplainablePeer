 "Overview:\nThis paper proposes an approach to curriculum learning, where subsets of examples to train on are chosen during the training process.[[INT-NEU], [null]]  The proposed method is based on a submodular set function over the examples, which is intended to capture diversity of the included examples and is added to the training objective (eq. 2).[[MET-NEU], [null]]  The set is optimized to be as hard as possible (maximize loss), which results in a min-max problem.[[MET-NEU,RES-NEU], [EMP-NEU]]  This is in turn optimized (approximately) by alternating between gradient-based loss minimization and submodular maximization.[[MET-NEU], [null]]  The theoretical analysis shows that if the loss is strongly convex, then the algorithm returns a solution which is close to the optimal solution.[[MET-NEU,ANA-NEU], [EMP-NEU]]  Empirical results are presented for several benchmarks.[[RES-NEU], [EMP-NEU]] \nThe paper is mostly clear and the idea seems nice.[[PDI-POS], [CLA-POS]]  On the downside, there are some limitations to the theoretical analysis and optimization scheme (see comments below).[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU]] \n\nComments:\n- The theoretical result (thm. 1) studies the case of full optimization, which is different than the proposed algorithm (running a fixed number of weight updates).[[MET-NEU,RES-NEG], [EMP-NEG]]  It would be interesting to show results on sensitivity to the number of updates (p).[[MET-NEU,RES-NEU], [EMP-NEU]] \n- The algorithm requires tuning of quite a few hyperparameters (sec. 3).[[EXP-NEU,MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU]] \n- Approximating a cluster with a single sample (sec. 2.3) seems rather crude.[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU]]  There should be some theoretical and/or empirical study of its effect on quality of the solution.[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU]] \n\nMinor/typos:\n- what is G(j|G\\j) in eq. (9)?[[MET-NEU], [PNF-NEU]] \n- why cite Anonymous (2018) instead of Appendix...?[[BIB-NEU], [null]] \n- define V in Thm. 1.\n- in eq. (4) it may be clearer to denote g_k(w). Likewise in eq. (6) \\hat{g}_\\hat{A}(w), and in eq. (14) \\tilde{g}_{\\cal{A}}(w).[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU]] \n- figures readability can be improved."[[TNF-NEU], [PNF-NEU]]
