 "The authors present a method that aims to remove domain-specific information while preserving the relevant biological information between biological data measured in different experiments or \"batches\".[[INT-NEU,EXP-NEU,MET-NEU], [null]]  A network is trained to learn the transformations that minimize the Wasserstein distance between distributions.[[MET-NEU], [null]]  The wasserstein distance is also called the \"earth mover distance\" and is traditionally formulated as the cost it takes for an optimal transport plan to move one distribution to another.[[MET-NEU], [null]]  In this paper they have a neural network compute the wasserstein distance using a different formulation that was used in Arjovsky et al. 2017, finds a lipschitz function f, which shows the maximal difference when evaluated on samples from the two distributions.[[RWK-NEU,EXP-NEU,MET-NEU], [null]]  Here these functions are formulated as affine transforms of the data with parameters theta that are computed by a neural network.[[DAT-NEU,EXP-NEU,MET-NEU], [null]]  Results are examined mainly by looking at the first two PCA components of the data.[[RES-NEU], [null]]   \n\n\nThe paper presents an interesting idea and is fairly well written.[[OAL-POS], [CLA-POS]]  However I have a few concerns:\n1. Most of the ideas presented in the paper rely on works by Arjovsky et al. (2017), Gulrajani et al. (2017), and Gulrajani et al. (2017).[[MET-NEU], [CMP-NEU]]  Some selections, which are presented in the papers are not explained, for example, the gradient penalty, the choice of \\lambda and the choice of points for gradient computation.[[MET-NEG], [SUB-NEG]] \n2. The experimental results are not fully convincing, they simply compare the first two PC components on this Broad Bioimage benchmark collection.[[MET-NEG,RES-NEG], [CMP-NEG,EMP-NEG]]  This section could be improved by demonstrating the approach on more datasets.[[DAT-NEU,MET-NEU], [SUB-NEU,EMP-NEU]] \n3. There is a lack comparison to other methods such as Shaham et al. (2017).[[RWK-NEG], [SUB-NEG,CMP-NEG]]  Why is using earth mover distance better than MMD based distance?[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU]]  They only compare it to a method named CORAL and to Typical\nVariation Normalization (TVN).[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU]]   What about comparison to other batch normalization methods in biology such as SEURAT? [[EXT-NEU], [null]]  \n4. Why is the affine transform assumption valid in biology?  [[EXT-NEU], [null]] There can definitely be non-linear effects that are different between batches, such as ion detection efficiency differences.[[OAL-NEU], [null]]  \n5. Only early stopping seems to constrain their model to be near identity.[[MET-NEU], [null]]  Doesn't this also prevent optimal results ?[[MET-NEU,RES-NEU], [EMP-NEU]]  How does this compare to the near-identity constraints in resnets in Shaham et al. ?\n\n"[[RWK-NEU], [CMP-NEU]]
