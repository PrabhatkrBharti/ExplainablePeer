 "This is a high-quality and clear paper looking at biologically-plausible learning algorithms for deep neural networks.[[INT-POS], [EMP-POS]]  The contributions here are: 1) experiments testing the DTP algorithm on more difficult datasets,[[DAT-NEU,EXP-NEU], [EMP-NEU]]  2) proposing a minor modification of the DTP algorithm at the output layer,[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU]]  and 3) testing the DTP algorithm on locally-connected architectures.[[EXP-NEU], [EMP-NEU]]  These are all novel contributions, but each one seems incremental in the context of previous work on this and similar algorithms (E.G. Nokland, Direct Feedback Alignment Provides Learning in Deep Neural Networks, 2016; Baldi et al, Learning in the Machine: The Symmetries of the Deep Learning Channel, 2017). \n\n"[[PDI-NEU], [NOV-NEU]]
