 "This paper investigates an effect of time dependencies in a specific type of RNN.[[INT-NEU], [null]] \n\nThe idea is important and this paper seems sound[[PDI-POS], [SUB-POS,IMP-POS]] . However, I am not sure that the main result (Theorem 1) explains an effect of depth sufficiently.[[RWK-NEU,RES-NEU,EXT-NEU], [null]] \n\n--Main comment\nAbout the deep network case in Theorem 1, how $L$ affects the bound on ranks?[[RWK-NEU,EXP-NEU,MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU]]  In the current statement, the result seems independent to $L$ when $L \\geq 2$.[[RWK-NEU,RES-NEU], [IMP-NEU]]  I think that this paper should quantify the effect of an increase of $L$.[[INT-POS,ANA-POS], [SUB-POS]] \n\n--Sub comment\nNumerical experiments for calculating the separation rank is necessary to provide evidence of the main result.[[RWK-NEU,EXP-NEU,RES-NEU], [IMP-NEU]]  Only a simple example will make this paper more convincing.[[RWK-NEG,EXP-NEG,FWK-NEG], [IMP-NEG,EMP-NEG]]
