 "3D data processing is very important topic nowadays, since it has a lot of applications: robotics, AR/VR, etc.[[EXT-NEU], [null]] \n\nCurrent approaches to 2D image processing based on Deep Neural Networks provide very accurate results and a wide variety of different architectures for image modelling, generation, classification, retrieval.[[EXT-NEU], [null]] \n\nThe lack of DL architectures for 3D data is due to complexity of representation of 3D data, especially when using 3D point clouds.[[EXT-NEU], [null]] \n\nConsidered paper is one of the first approaches to learn GAN-type generative models.[[PDI-NEU,MET-NEU], [NOV-POS]] \nUsing PointNet architecture and latent-space GAN, the authors obtained rather accurate generative model.[[MET-POS,RES-POS], [EMP-POS]] \n\nThe paper is well written, results of experiments are convincing, the authors provided the code on the github, realizing their architectures.[[EXP-POS,RES-POS,OAL-POS], [CLA-POS,EMP-POS]]  \n\nThus I think that the paper should be published."[[OAL-POS], [REC-POS]]
