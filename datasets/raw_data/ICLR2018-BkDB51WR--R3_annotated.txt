 "This work proposes an LSTM based model for time-evolving probability densities.[[INT-NEU], [null]]  The model does not assume an explicit prior over the underlying dynamical systems, instead only uncertainty over observation noise is explicitly considered.[[PDI-NEU], [null]]  Experiments results are good for given synthetic scenarios[[EXP-POS], [EMP-POS]]  but less convincing for real data. [[DAT-NEG], [EMP-NEG]]  \n\nClarity: The paper is well-written. [[OAL-POS], [CLA-POS]] Some notations in the LSTM section could be better explained for readers who are unfamiliar with LSTMs.[[MET-NEU], [PNF-NEG]]  Otherwise, the paper is well-structured and easy to follow.\[[OAL-POS], [PNF-POS]] n\nOriginality: I'm not familiar with LSTMs, it is hard for me to judge the originality here.[[MET-NEU,EXT-NEU], [NOV-NEU]] \n\nSignificance: Average.[[OAL-POS], [IMP-POS]]  The work would be stronger if the authors can extend this to higher dimensional time series.[[ANA-NEU,FWK-NEU], [IMP-NEU]]  There are also many papers on this topic using Gaussian process state-space (GP-SSM) models where an explicit prior is assumed over the underlying dynamical systems.[[RWK-NEU,EXT-NEU], [CMP-NEU]]  The authors might want to comment on the relative merits between GP-SSMs and DE-RNNs.[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU]] \n\nThe SMC algorithm used is a sequential-importance-sampling (SIS) method.[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU]]  I think it's correct but may not scale well with dimensions."[[ANA-NEG], [EMP-NEG]]
