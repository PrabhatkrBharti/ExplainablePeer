 "This paper considers the problem of self-normalizing models. This kind\nof approaches, such as NCE (Noise Contrastive Estimation) is very\npromising and important to provide efficient and large vocabulary\nlanguage models.[[INT-POS], [null]] \n\nBy interpreting the NCE in terms of matrix factorization allows the\nauthors to better explain this learning criterion and more\nspecifically the self-normalizing mechanism.[[MET-POS], [EMP-POS]] \n\nHowever, the first (theoritical) contribution is to make the link\nbetween matrix decomposition and sampling based objective.[[MET-NEU], [null]]  This was\nalready shown for negative sampling in the paper of Melamud et al. in\nEMNLP 2017. Therefore, nothing new here, the difference is slight.[[RWK-NEG,MET-NEG], [NOV-NEG]] \nMoreover, this paper is only cited in the experimental part, while the\ncontribution should be far more emphasized by the authors.[[EXP-NEG], [CMP-NEG]] \n\nThe second part makes the link with the self-normalization. This is\nnot really surprising. This was already explained in the same way in\npapers from Pihlaja,Gutmann and Hyvarinen published in 2010/12.[[RWK-NEG,MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG]]
