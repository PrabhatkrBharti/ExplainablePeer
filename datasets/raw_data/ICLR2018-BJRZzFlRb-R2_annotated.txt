 "This paper presents an interesting idea to word embeddings that it combines a few base vectors to generate new word embeddings. [[INT-POS,PDI-POS], [NOV-NEU]] It also adopts an interesting multicodebook approach for encoding than binary embeddings.[[MET-POS], [EMP-POS]]  \n\nThe paper presents the proposed approach to a few NLP problems and have shown that this is able to significant reduce the size, increase compression ratio, and still achieved good accuracy.[[MET-POS,RES-POS], [IMP-POS,EMP-POS]] \n\nThe experiments are convincing and solid.[[EXP-POS], [EMP-POS]]  Overall I am weakly inclined to accept this paper."[[OAL-POS], [REC-POS]]
