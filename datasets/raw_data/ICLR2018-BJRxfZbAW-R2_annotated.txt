 "This paper introduces a conditional variant of the model defined in the Neural Statistician (https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.02185).[[INT-NEU], [null]]  The generative model defines the process that produces the dataset.[[DAT-NEU,MET-NEU], [null]]  This model is first a mixture over contexts followed by i.i.d. generation of the dataset with possibly some unobserved random variable.[[DAT-NEU,MET-NEU], [null]]  This corresponds to a mixture of Neural Statisicians.[[PDI-NEU], [null]]  The authors suggest that such a model could help with disentangling factors of variation in data.[[DAT-NEU,MET-NEU], [null]]  In the experiments they only consider training the model with the context selection variable and the data variables observed.[[DAT-NEU,EXP-NEU], [null]] \n\nUnfortunately there is minimal quantitative evaluation (visualizing 264 MNIST samples is not enough).[[DAT-NEG,MET-NEG], [SUB-NEG]]  The only quantitative evaluation is in Table 1, and it seems the model is not able to generalize reliably to all rotations and all digits.[[MET-NEG,RES-NEG,TNF-NEG], [EMP-NEG]]  Clearly, we can't expect perfect performance, but there are some troubling results: 5.2 accuracy on non-rotated 0s, 0.0 accuracy on non-rotated 6s.[[RES-NEG], [EMP-NEG]]  Every digit has at least one rotation that is not well classified, so this section could use more discussion and analysis.[[MET-NEG,ANA-NEG], [EMP-NEG]]  For example, how would this metric classify VAE samples with contexts corresponding only to digit type (no rotations)? How would this metric classify vanilla VAE samples that are hand labeled?[[DAT-NEU], [EMP-NEU]]  Moreover, the context selection variable \"a\" should be considered part of the dataset, and as such the paper should report how \"a\" was selected.[[DAT-NEG,MET-NEG], [SUB-NEG]] \n\nThis model is a relatively simple extension of the Neural Statistician, so the novelty of the idea is not enough to counterbalance the lack of quantitative evaluation.[[PDI-NEG,MET-NEG], [NOV-NEG,SUB-NEG]]  I do think the idea is well-motivated, and represents a promising way to incorporate prior knowledge of concepts into our training of VAEs.[[PDI-POS,EXP-POS], [CMP-POS,EMP-POS]]  Still, the paper as it stands is not complete, and I encourage the authors to followup with more thorough quantitative empirical evaluations.\n"[[OAL-NEG], [SUB-NEG,EMP-NEG]]
