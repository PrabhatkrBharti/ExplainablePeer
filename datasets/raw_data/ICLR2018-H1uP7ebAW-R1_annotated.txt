 "The paper proposes to combine the recently proposed DenseNet architecture with LSTMs to tackle the problem of predicting different pathologic patterns from chest x-rays.[[INT-NEU,PDI-NEU], [null]]  In particular, the use of LSTMs helps take into account interdependencies between pattern labels.[[MET-NEU], [null]]  \n\nStrengths:\n- The paper is very well written.[[OAL-POS], [CLA-POS]]  Contextualization with respect to previous work is adequate.[[RWK-POS], [EMP-POS]]  Explanations are clear.[[OAL-POS], [CLA-POS]]  Novelties are clearly identified by the authors.[[OAL-POS], [NOV-POS]] \n- Quantitative improvement with respect to the state the art.[[RWK-POS], [CMP-POS]]  \n\nWeaknesses:\n- The paper does not introduce strong technical novelties -- mostly, it seems to apply previous techniques to the medical domain.[[MET-NEG], [NOV-NEG]]  It could have been interesting to know if there are more insights / lessons learned in this process.[[MET-NEU], [SUB-NEU]]  This could be of interest for a broader audience.[[MET-POS,EXT-POS], [EMP-POS]]  For instance, what are the implications of using higher-resolution images as input to DenseNet / decreasing the number of layers?[[DAT-NEU,MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU]]  How do the features learned at different layers compare to the ones of the original network trained for image classification?[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU]]  How do features of networks pre-trained on ImageNet, and then fine-tuned for the medical domain, compare to features learned from medical images from scratch?[[DAT-NEU,MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU]]  \n- The impact of the proposed approach on medical diagnostics is unclear.[[MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG]]  The authors could better discuss how the approach could be adopted in practice.[[MET-NEG], [SUB-NEG]]  Also, it could be interesting also to discuss how the results in Table 2 and 3 compare to human classification capabilities, and if that performance would be already enough for building a computer-aided diagnosis system.[[RES-NEU], [SUB-NEU]] \n\nFinally -- is it expected that the ordering of the factorization in Eq. 3 does not count much (results in Table 3)?[[MET-NEU,RES-NEU,TNF-NEU], [EMP-NEU]]  As a non-expert in the field, I'd expect that ordering between pathologic patterns matters more."[[EXT-NEU], [CNT]]
