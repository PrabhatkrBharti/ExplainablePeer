 "This paper focuses on accelerating RNN by applying the method from Blelloch (1990).[[INT-NEU,MET-NEU], [null]]  The application is straightforward and thus technical novelty of this paper is limited.[[PDI-NEG], [NOV-NEG]]  But the results are impressive.[[RES-POS,OAL-POS], [IMP-POS]]  \n\nOne concern is the proposed technique is only applied for few types of RNNs which may limit its applications in practice.[[RWK-NEU,PDI-NEG,MET-NEG], [IMP-NEG,EMP-NEG]]  Could the authors comment on this potential limitation?[[RWK-NEU], [null]]
