 "The authors propose a generative method that can produce images along a hierarchy of specificity, i.e. both when all relevant attributes are specified, [[PDI-POS,MET-POS], [EMP-POS]] and when some are left undefined, creating a more abstract generation task.[[PDI-NEU,MET-NEU], [null]]  \n\nPros:\n+ The results demonstrating the method's ability to generate results for (1) abstract and (2) novel/unseen attribute descriptions, are generally convincing[[ABS-POS,MET-POS,RES-POS], [NOV-POS]] . Both quantitative and qualitative results are provided.[[RWK-POS,RES-POS], [SUB-POS]]  \n+ The paper is fairly clea[[INT-POS], [CLA-POS]] r.\n\nCons:\n- It is unclear how to judge diversity qualitatively, e.g. in Fig. 4(b)[[RWK-NEG,TNF-NEG], [CLA-NEG]] .\n- Fig. 5 could be more convincing; \"bushy eyebrows\" is a difficult attribute to judge[[RWK-NEG,TNF-NEG], [null]] , and in the abstract generation when that is the only attribute specified, it is not clear how good the results are.\n"[[ABS-NEG,RES-NEU], [CLA-NEG]]
