 "The work claims a measure of robustness of networks that is attack-agnostic.[[INT-NEU], [null]]  Robustness measure is turned into the problem of finding a local Lipschitz constant which is given by the maximum of the norm of the gradient of the associated function.[[MET-NEU], [null]]  That quantity is then estimated by sampling from the domain of maximization and observing the maximum value of the norm out of those samples.[[DAT-NEU,MET-NEU], [null]]  Such a maximum process is then described by the reverse Weibull distribution which is used in the estimation.[[MET-NEU], [null]] \n\nThe paper closely follows Hein and Andriushchenko (2017).[[RWK-NEU], [null]]  There is a slight modification that enlarges the class of functions for which the theory is applicable (Lemma 3.3).[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU]]  As far as I know, the contribution of the work starts in Section 4 where the authors show how to practically estimate the maximum process through back-prop where mini-batching helps increase the number of samples.[[EXP-NEU,MET-NEU], [SUB-POS,EMP-POS]]  This is a rather simple idea that is shown to be effective in Figure 3.[[PDI-NEU,TNF-NEU], [NOV-NEU]]  The following section (the part starting from 5.3) presents the key to the success of the proposed measure.[[MET-POS], [EMP-POS]]  \n\nThis is an important problem and the paper attempts to tackle it in a computationally efficient way.[[PDI-POS,MET-POS], [EMP-POS]]  The fact that the norms of attacks are slightly above the proposed score is promising, however, there is always the risk of finding a lower bound that is too small (zeros and large gaps in Figure 3). [[MET-NEU,TNF-NEU], [EMP-NEU]] It would be nice to be able to show that one can find corresponding attacks that are not too far away from the proposed score.[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU]] \n\nFinally, a minor point: Definition 3.1 has a confusing notation, f is a K-valued vector throughout the paper but it also denotes the number that represents the prediction in Definition 3.1. I believe this is just a typo.[[MET-NEU], [CLA-NEG]] \n\nEdit: Thanks for the fixes and clarification of essential parts in the paper.[[OAL-POS], [null]]
