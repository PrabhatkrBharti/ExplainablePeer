 "Summary of paper:\n\nThe paper proposes a unique network architecture that can learn divide-and-conquer strategies to solve algorithmic tasks.[[INT-NEU,PDI-NEU], [null]] \n\nReview:\n\nThe paper is clearly written.[[OAL-POS], [CLA-POS]]  It is sometimes difficult to communicate ideas in this area, so I appreciate the author's effort in choosing good notation.[[OAL-POS], [PNF-POS]]  Using an architecture to learn how to split the input, find solutions, then merge these is novel.[[MET-POS], [NOV-POS]]  Previous work in using recursion to solve problems (Cai 2017) used explicit supervision to learn how to split and recurse.[[RWK-NEU], [null]]  The ideas and formalism of the merge and partition operations are valuable contributions.[[MET-POS], [EMP-POS]]   \n\nThe experimental side of the paper is less strong.[[EXP-NEG], [EMP-NEG]]   There are good results on the convex hull problem, which is promising.[[RES-POS], [EMP-POS]]   There should also be a comparison to a k-means solver in the k-means section as an additional baseline.[[MET-NEG], [SUB-NEG,CMP-NEG]]   I'm also not sure TSP is an appropriate problem to demonstrate the method's effectiveness.[[MET-POS], [EMP-POS]]   Perhaps another problem that has an explicit divide and conquer strategy could be used instead.[[PDI-NEU,MET-NEU], [SUB-NEU]]   It would also be nice to observe failure cases of the model.[[MET-NEU], [SUB-NEU]]   This could be done by visually showing the partition constructed or seeing how the model learned to merge solutions..[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU]] \n\nThis is a relatively new area to tackle, so while the experiments section could be strengthened, I think the ideas present in the paper are important and worth publishing.[[PDI-POS,MET-NEU], [EMP-POS]] \n\nQuestions:\n\n1. What is \\rho on page 4?.[[CNT], [null]]  I assume it is some nonlinearity, but this was not specified.[[CNT], [null]] \n2. On page 5, it says the merge block takes as input two sequences.[[CNT], [null]]  I thought the merge block was defined on sets?[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU]]  \n\nTypos:\n1. Author's names should be enclosed in parentheses unless part of the sentence.[[CNT], [CLA-NEG]] \n2. I believe \"then\" should be removed in the sentence \"...scale invariance, then exploiting...\" on page 2."[[CNT], [CLA-NEG]]
