 "This paper presents some reviews on clustering methods with deep learning.[[INT-NEU,PDI-NEU,MET-NEU], [null]]  Based on the review taxonomy, the authors presents a mixed objective which aims for bretter clustering performance.[[PDI-POS,RES-POS], [null]]  The proposed method is then tested on two image data sets.\n\n[[DAT-NEU,MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU]] The claimed main contribution of the paper is the taxonomy.[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU]]  There are no new things in such kind of reviews.[[MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG]]  The taxonomy gives no scientific axioms.[[MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG]]  Therefore the impact or actual contribution to the ICLR community is very limited.\n\n[[OAL-NEG], [APR-NEG,IMP-NEG]] The proposed clustering method is problematic.[[MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG]]  It is hard to set the paramter alpha.[[EXP-NEG,MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG]]  The experimental results are also disappointing.[[EXP-NEG,RES-NEG], [EMP-NEG]]  For example, the COIL20 accuracy is only 0.762, much worse than the state of the art.[[RWK-NEG,RES-NEG], [CMP-NEG,EMP-NEG]]  Moreover, results on only two image data sets are not sufficient for convincing."[[DAT-NEG,RES-NEG], [SUB-NEG]]
