 "This paper surveys models for collaborative filtering with user/item covariate.[[INT-NEU,PDI-NEU], [null]]  \n\nOverall the authors seems to have captured the essence of a large number of popular CF models and I found that the proposed model classification is reasonable.[[PDI-POS,MET-POS], [EMP-POS]]  The notation also make it easy to understand the differences between different models.[[MET-POS], [PNF-POS]]  In that sense this paper could be useful to researchers wanting to better understand this field.[[FWK-POS], [IMP-POS]]  It may also be useful to develop further insights into current models (although the authors do not go that route).[[FWK-POS], [IMP-POS]]  \n\nThe impact of this paper may be limited in this community since it is a survey about a fairly niche topic (a subset of recommender systems) that may not be of central interest at ICLR. [[FWK-NEG,OAL-NEG], [APR-NEG,IMP-NEG]] Overall, I think this paper would be a better fit in a recsys, applied ML or information retrieval journal.[[EXT-POS], [APR-NEU]] \n\n\nA few comments: \n\nI find that there are several ways the paper could make a stronger contribution:[[OAL-NEU], [IMP-NEU]]  \n1) Use the unifying notation to discuss strengths and weaknesses of current approaches (ideally with insights about possible future approaches).\[[MET-NEU,FWK-NEU], [PNF-NEU]] n2) Report the results of a large study of many of the surveyed models on a large number of datasets.[[DAT-NEU,RES-NEU], [EMP-NEU]]  Ideally further insights could be derived from these results.\[[RES-NEU,FWK-NEU], [IMP-NEU]] n3) Provide a common code framework with all methods\[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU]] n4) Add a discussion on more structured sources of covariates (e.g., social networks).[[ANA-NEU], [SUB-NEU]]  This could probably more or less easily be added as a subsection using the current classification.[[ANA-NEU], [SUB-NEU]] \n\n- A similar classification of collaborative filtering models with covariates is proposed in this thesis (p.41):\nhttps://tspace.library.utoronto.ca/bitstream/1807/68831/1/Charlin_Laurent_201406_PhD_thesis.pdf[[RWK-NEU,BIB-NEU], [CMP-NEU]] \n\n- The paper is well written overall[[OAL-POS], [CLA-POS]]  but the current version of the paper contains several typos."[[OAL-NEG], [CLA-NEG]]
