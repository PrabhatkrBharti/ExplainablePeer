 "The paper aims to address a common issue in many classification applications: that the number of training data from different classes is much unbalanced.[[INT-NEU,PDI-NEU], [null]]  The paper proposes a Bayesian framework to address it with a Gaussian mixture model.[[INT-NEU,MET-NEU], [null]] \n\nOverall the math looks reasonable.[[MET-POS], [EMP-POS]]  I am not sure about the novelty of the paper, as it is a relatively standard definition of Bayesian math.[[RWK-NEU,MET-NEU], [NOV-NEU,CMP-NEU]]  Essentially, instead of computing a softmax prediction which is the discrimination probability of each class given the input, one uses a logistic regression type interpretation (equation 1).[[EXP-NEU,MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU]]  This has been used in multi-class classification before.[[RWK-NEG,MET-NEG], [NOV-NEG,CMP-NEG]]  For example, many early SVM papers deal with multi-class classification by training 1-vs-all classifiers on each class and then choose the one having the highest score (possibly with a class-prior adjustment).\[[RWK-NEU,EXT-NEU], [CMP-NEU]] n\nNote that this actually changes the underlying assumption a bit: softmax basically assumes the classes are mutually exclusive, while this interpretation implicitly assumes that the classes are not related to each other - an image could belong to multiple classes.[[RWK-NEU,MET-NEU], [CMP-NEU]]  This probably does not match the assumption of many of the datasets being tested upon (CIFAR, MNIST) but I don't consider that a fundamental issue.[[DAT-NEU], [CMP-NEU,EMP-NEU]] \n\nI am quite a bit concerned about the experimentation protocol as well.[[EXP-NEG], [EMP-NEG]]  The datasets are relatively smaller scale, and datasets such as MNIST and CIFAR are known to overfit.[[DAT-NEG], [SUB-NEG]]  As a result, although there are approaches taken to generate unbalanced datasets out of them (e.g. MNIST).[[DAT-NEU,MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU]]  Regardless, the results seem to suggest that the proposed method is similar to softmax performance - which is expected as they are similar - but I am not sure if it accurately evaluated / analyzed the possible application and performance gain of the proposed method."[[MET-NEG,RES-NEG], [NOV-NEG,CMP-NEG,EMP-NEG]]
