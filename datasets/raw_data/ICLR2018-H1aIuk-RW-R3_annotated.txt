 "This paper studies active learning for convolutional neural networks[[INT-NEU], [null]] . Authors formulate the active learning problem as core-set selection and present a novel strategy.[[MET-POS], [NOV-POS]] \n\nExperiments are performed on three datasets to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method comparing with some baselines.[[RWK-NEU,DAT-NEU,EXP-NEU], [EMP-NEU]] \n\nTheoretical analysis is presented to show the performance of any selected subset using the geometry of the data points.[[MET-NEU,DAT-NEU], [EMP-NEU]] \n\nAuthors are suggested to perform experiments on more datasets to make the results more convincing.[[DAT-NEU,EXP-NEU], [SUB-NEU]] \n\nThe initialization of the CNN model is not clearly introduced, which however, may affect the performance significantly.[[MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG]]
