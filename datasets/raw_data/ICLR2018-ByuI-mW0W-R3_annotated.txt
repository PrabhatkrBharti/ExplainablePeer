 "This paper proposed a procedure for assessing the performance of GANs by re-considering the key of observation.[[INT-NEU], [null]]  And using the procedure to test and improve current version of GANs. It demonstrated some interesting stuff.[[MET-POS], [EMP-POS]]  \n\nIt is not easy to follow the main idea of the paper.[[PDI-NEG], [CLA-NEG]]  The paper just told difference stories section by section.[[OAL-NEU], [null]]  Based on my understanding, the claims are 1) the new formalization of the goal of GAN training and 2) using this test to evaluate the success of GAN algorithms empirically? [[PDI-NEU], [null]]  I suggested that the author should reform the structure, ignore some unrelated content and make the clear claims about the contributions on the introduction part. [[INT-NEU,MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU]]  \n\nRegarding the experimental part, it can not make strong support for all the claims.[[EXP-NEU], [EMP-NEG]]  Figure 2 showed almost similar plots for all the varieties.[[TNF-NEG], [EMP-NEG]]  Meanwhile, the results are performed on some specific model configurations (like ResNet) and settings. It is difficult to justify whether it can generalize to other cases.[[EXP-NEU,MET-NEU], [SUB-NEG,EMP-NEU]]  Some of the figures do not have the notations of curvey, making people hard to compare.[[TNF-NEU], [PNF-NEG]]  \n\nTherefore, I think the current version is not ready to be published. The author can make it stronger and consider next venue.[[OAL-NEG], [REC-NEG]]
