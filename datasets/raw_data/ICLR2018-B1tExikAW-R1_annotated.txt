 "The idea is clearly stated (but lacks some details) and I enjoyed reading the paper.[[PDI-POS], [CNT]]  \n\nI understand the difference between [Kos+17] and the proposed scheme but I could not understand in which situation the proposed scheme works better.[[RWK-NEG,MET-NEG], [CMP-NEG,EMP-NEG]]  From the adversary's standpoint, it would be easier to manipulate inputs than latent variables.[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU]]  On the other hand, I agree that sample-independent perturbation is much more practical than sample-dependent perturbation.[[MET-NEU], [CMP-NEU]] \n\nIn Section 3.1, the attack methods #2 and #3 should be detailed more.[[MET-NEU], [SUB-NEG]]  I could not imagine how VAE and T are trained simultaneously.[[EXP-NEU,MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU]] \n\nIn Section 3.2, the authors listed a couple of loss functions.[[MET-NEU], [null]]  How were these loss functions are combined?[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU]]  The final optimization problem that is used for training of the propose VAE should be formally defined.[[MET-NEU,ANA-NEU], [EMP-NEU]]  Also, the detailed specification of the VAE should be detailed.[[MET-NEU], [SUB-NEU]] \n\nFrom figures in Figure 4 and Figure 5, I could see that the proposed scheme performs successfully in a qualitative manner,[[MET-POS,TNF-POS], [EMP-POS]]  however, it is difficult to evaluate the proposed scheme qualitatively without comparisons with baselines.[[RWK-NEG,MET-NEG], [CMP-NEG]]  For example, can the proposed scheme can be compared with [Kos+17] or some other sample-dependent attacks?[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU]]  Also, can you experimentally show that attacks on latent variables are more powerful than attacks on inputs?\n\n\n"[[EXP-NEU,ANA-NEU], [EMP-NEU]]
