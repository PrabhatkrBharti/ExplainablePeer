 "The paper proposes a method to train deep multi-task networks using gradient normalization.[[INT-NEU], [null]]  The key idea is to enforce the gradients from multi tasks balanced so that no tasks are ignored in the training.[[PDI-NEU], [null]]  The authors also demonstrated that the technique can improve test errors over single task learning and uncertainty weighting on a large real-world dataset.[[MET-NEU], [null]] \n\nIt is an interesting paper with a novel approach to multi-task learning[[PDI-POS,OAL-POS], [NOV-POS]] . To improve the paper, it would be helpful to evaluate the method under various settings.[[MET-NEU,EXT-NEU], [null]]  My detailed comments are below.\n\n1. Multi-task learning can have various settings. For example, we may have multiple groups of tasks, where tasks are correlated within groups but tasks in different groups are not much correlated.[[MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG]]  Also, tasks may have hierarchical correlation structures.[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU]]  These patterns often appear in biological datasets. [[DAT-NEU], [null]] I am wondering how a variety of multi-task settings can be handled by the proposed approach.[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU]]  It would be helpful to discuss the conditions where we can benefit from the proposed method.[[EXP-NEU,MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU]] \n\n2. One intuitive approach to task balancing would be to weight each task objective based on the variance of each task. [[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU]]  It would be helpful to add a few simple and intuitive baselines in the experiments.[[EXP-NEU], [EMP-NEU]]  \n\n3. In Section 4, it would be great to have more in-depth simulations (e.g., multi-task learning in various settings).[[EXP-NEU,MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU]]  Also, in the bottom right panel in Figure 2, GrandNorm and equal weighting decrease test errors effectively even after 15000 steps but uncertainty weighting seems to reach a plateau. Discussions on this would be useful.[[EXP-NEU,TNF-NEU], [EMP-NEU]] \n\n4. It would be useful to discuss the implementation of the method as well. [[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU]]
