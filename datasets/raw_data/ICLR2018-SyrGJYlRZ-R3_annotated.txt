 "[Apologies for short review, I got called in late.[[EXT-NEU], [null]]  Marking my review as \"educated guess\" since i didn't have time for a detailed review][[EXT-NEU], [null]] \n\nThe paper proposes an algorithm to tune the momentum and learning rate for SGD.[[INT-NEU,PDI-NEU,MET-NEU], [null]]  While the algorithm does not have a theory for general non-quadratic functions,[[MET-NEU], [SUB-NEG]]  experimental validation is extensive, making it a worthy contribution in my opinion.[[EXP-POS], [EMP-POS]]  I have personally tried the algorithm when the paper came out and can vouch for the empirical results presented here."[[MET-POS,RES-POS], [EMP-POS]]
