 "The paper proposes a method to synthesize adversarial examples that remain robust to different 2D and 3D perturbations.[[INT-NEU,PDI-NEU], [null]]  The paper shows this is effective by transferring the examples to 3D objects that are color 3D-printed and show some nice results.[[MET-POS,RES-POS], [EMP-POS]] \n\nThe experimental results and video showing that the perturbation is effective for different camera angles, lighting conditions and background is quite impressive.[[EXP-POS,RES-POS], [EMP-POS]]  This work convincingly shows that adversarial examples are a real-world problem for production deep-learning systems rather than something that is only academically interesting.[[PDI-POS], [EMP-POS]] \n\nHowever, the authors claim that standard techniques require complete control and careful setups (e.g. in the camera case) is quite misleading, especially with regards to the work by Kurakin et. al.[[RWK-NEG,MET-NEG], [CMP-NEG,EMP-NEG]]  This paper also seems to have some problems of its own (for example the turtle is at relatively the same distance from the camera in all the examples, I expect the perturbation wouldn't work well if it was far enough away that the camera could not resolve the HD texture of the turtle).[[MET-NEG,RES-NEG], [EMP-NEG]] \n\nOne interesting point this work raises is whether the algorithm is essentially learning universal perturbations (Moosavi-Dezfooli et. al).[[RWK-POS,MET-POS], [CMP-POS]]  If that's the case then complicated transformation sampling and 3D mapping setup would be unnecessary.[[MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG]]  This may already be the case since the training set already consists of multiple lighting, rotation and camera type transformations so I would expect universal perturbations to already produce similar results in the real-world.[[EXP-NEU,MET-NEU,RES-NEU], [EMP-NEU]] \n\nMinor comments:\nSection 1.1: \"a affine\" -> \"an affine\"\nTypo in section 3.4: \"of a of a[[CNT], [CLA-NEG]] \"\nIt's interesting in figure 9 that the crossword puzzle appears in the image of the lighthouse.[[TNF-POS], [PNF-POS]] \n\nMoosavi-Dezfooli, S.
