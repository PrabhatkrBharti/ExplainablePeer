 "This paper proposed a class of control variate methods based on Stein's identity.[[INT-NEU], [null]]  Stein's identity has been widely used in classical statistics and recently in statistical machine learning literature.[[RWK-NEU], [null]]  Nevertheless, applying Stein's identity to estimating policy gradient is a novel approach in reinforcement learning community.[[MET-POS], [NOV-POS]]  To me, this approach is the right way of constructing control variates for estimating policy gradient.[[MET-POS], [EMP-POS]]  The authors also did a good job in connecting with existing works and gave concrete examples for Gaussian policies.[[RWK-POS], [CMP-POS]]  The experimental results also look promising.[[EXP-POS], [null]] \n\nIt would be nice to include some theoretical analyses like under what conditions, the proposed method can achieve smaller sample complexity than existing works.   [[MET-NEU,ANA-NEU], [EMP-NEU]]  \n\nOverall this is a strong paper and I recommend to accept.\n \n\n\n"[[OAL-POS], [REC-POS]]
