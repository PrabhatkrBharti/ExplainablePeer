 "This paper presents a method based on GANs for visualizing how humans represent visual categories.[[INT-NEU], [null]]  Authors perform experiments on two datasets: Asian Faces Dataset and ImageNet Large Scale Recognition Challenge dataset.[[DAT-NEU,EXP-NEU], [null]] \n\nPositive aspects:\n+ The idea of using GANs for this goal is smart and interesting[[PDI-POS], [EMP-POS]] \n+ The results seem interesting too[[RES-POS], [EMP-POS]] \n\nWeaknesses:\n- Some aspects of the paper are not clear and presentation needs improvement.[[OAL-NEG], [CLA-NEG,PNF-NEG]] \n- I miss a clearer results comparison with previous methods, like Vondrick et al. 2015.[[RWK-NEG,RES-NEG], [CMP-NEG]] \n\nSpecific comments and questions:\n\n-  Figure 1 is not clear.[[TNF-NEG], [PNF-NEG]]  Authors should clarify how they use the inference network and what the two arrows from this inference network represent.[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU]] \n- Figure 2 is also not clear.[[TNF-NEG], [PNF-NEG]]  Just the FLD projections of the MCMCP chains are difficult to interpret.[[MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG]]  The legend of the figure is too tiny.[[TNF-NEG], [PNF-NEG]]  The right part of the figure should be better described in the text or in the caption, I don't understand well what this illustrates.[[TNF-NEG], [PNF-NEG]] \n- Regarding to the human experiments with AMT: how do the authors deal with noise on the workers performance?[[EXP-NEU], [EMP-NEU]]  Is any qualification task used?[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU]]  What are the instructions given to the workers?[[CNT], [CNT]] \n- In section 4.2. the authors state \"We also simultaneously learn a corresponding inference network, .... granular human biases captured\".[[MET-NEU], [null]]  This seems interesting[[CNT], [CNT]]  but I didn't find any result on that in the paper.[[RES-NEG], [EMP-NEG]]  Can you give more details or refer to where in the paper it is discussed/tested?[[MET-NEU,RES-NEU], [SUB-NEU]] \n- Figure 4 shows \"most interpretable mixture components\".[[RES-NEU,TNF-NEU], [EMP-NEU]]   How this \"most interpretable\" were selected?[[RES-NEU], [EMP-NEU]] \n- In second paragraph Section 4.3, it should be Table 1 instead of Figure 1.[[TNF-NEG], [PNF-NEG]]  \n- It would be interesting to see a discussion on why MCMCP Density is better for group 1 and MCMCP Mean is better for group 2.[[MET-NEU], [SUB-NEU]]  To see the confusion matrixes could be useful.[[MET-NEU,FWK-NEU], [IMP-NEU]] \n\nI like this paper.[[OAL-POS], [CNT]]  The addressed problem is challenging and the proposed idea seems interesting.[[PDI-POS], [EMP-POS]]   However, the aspects mentioned make me think the paper needs some improvements to be published.\n"[[OAL-NEG], [APR-NEG,REC-NEG]]
