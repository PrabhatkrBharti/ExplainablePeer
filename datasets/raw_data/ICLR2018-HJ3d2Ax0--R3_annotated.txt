 "The paper proposes to use the start-end rank to measure the long-term dependency in RNNs.[[PDI-NEU,MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU]]  It shows that deep RNN is signficantly better than shallow one in this metric.[[RWK-NEU,MET-POS], [EMP-POS]]  \n\nThe theory part seems to be technical enough and interesting,[[RWK-POS,EXP-POS,MET-POS], [IMP-POS,EMP-POS]]  though I haven't checked all the details[[RWK-NEU], [null]] . The main concern with the paper is that I am not sure whether the RAC studied by the paper is realistic enough for practice. [[RWK-NEU,EXP-NEU,EXT-NEG], [null]] Certain gating in RNN is very useful but I don't know whether one can train any reasonable RNN with all multiplicative gates[[RWK-NEU,MET-NEU,RES-NEU], [EMP-NEU]] . The paper will be much stronger if it has some experiments along this line. "[[RWK-NEG,EXP-NEG,EXT-NEU], [SUB-NEG,IMP-NEG]]
