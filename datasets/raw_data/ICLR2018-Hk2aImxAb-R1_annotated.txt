 "This work proposes a variation of the DenseNet architecture that can cope with computational resource limits at test time.[[RWK-NEU], [EMP-NEU]]  The paper is very well written, experiments are clearly presented and convincing and, most importantly, the research question is exciting (and often overlooked).[[PDI-POS,EXP-POS,OAL-POS], [CLA-POS]]  \n\nMy only major concern is the degree of technical novelty with respect to the original DenseNet paper of Huang et al. (2017).[[PDI-NEU,BIB-NEU], [NOV-NEU,EMP-NEU]]  The authors add a hierarchical, multi-scale structure and show that DenseNet can better cope with it than ResNet (e.g., Fig. 3).[[RWK-NEU,MET-NEU,TNF-NEU], [EMP-NEU]]  They investigate pros and cons in detail adding more valuable analysis in the appendix.[[RWK-NEU,BIB-NEU], [null]]  However, this work is basically an extension of the DenseNet approach with a new problem statement and additional, in-depth analysis. [[RWK-NEU,PDI-POS,ANA-POS], [EMP-POS]]   \n\nSome more minor comments: \n\n-\tPlease enlarge Fig. 4.[[TNF-NEG], [PNF-NEG]]  \n-\tI did not fully grasp the details in the first \"Solution\" paragraph on P5.[[RWK-NEG], [null]]  Please extend and describe in more detail.[[RWK-NEG], [SUB-NEG,EMP-NEG]]  \n\nIn conclusion, this is a very well written paper that designs the network architecture (of DenseNet) such that it is optimized to include CPU budgets at test time.[[MET-POS,OAL-POS], [CLA-POS,EMP-POS]]  I recommend acceptance to ICLR18.[[EXT-POS], [null]]
