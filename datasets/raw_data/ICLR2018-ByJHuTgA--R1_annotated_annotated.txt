 "The submitted manuscript describes an exercise in performance comparison for neural language models under standardization of the hyperparameter tuning and model selection strategies and costs.[[INT-POS], [null]]  This type of study is important to give perspective to non-standardized performance scores reported across separate publications,[[RWK-POS], [CMP-POS]]  and indeed the results here are interesting as they favour relatively simpler structures.[[RES-POS], [EMP-POS]] \n\nI have a favourable impression of this paper[[OAL-POS], [REC-POS]]  but would hope another reviewer is more familiar with the specific application domain than I am."[[EXT-NEU], [null]]
