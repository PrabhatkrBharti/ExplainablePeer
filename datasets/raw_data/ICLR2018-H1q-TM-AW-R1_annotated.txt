 "This paper presents two complementary models for unsupervised domain adaptation (classification task): 1) the Virtual Adversarial Domain Adaptation (VADA) and 2) the Decision-boundary Iterative Refinement Training with a Teacher (DIRT-T).[[INT-NEU], [null]]  The authors make use of the so-called cluster assumption, i.e., decision boundaries should not cross high-density data regions.[[MET-NEU], [null]]  VADA extends the standard Domain-Adversarial training by introducing an additional objective L_t that measures the target-side cluster assumption violation, namely, the conditional entropy w.r.t. the target distribution.[[MET-NEU], [NULL]]  Since the empirical estimate of the conditional entropy breaks down for non-locally-Lipschitz classifiers, the authors also propose to incorporate virtual adversarial training in order to make the classifier well-behaved.[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU]]  The paper also argues that the performance on the target domain can be further improved by a post-hoc minimization of L_t using natural gradient descent (DIRT-T) which ensures that the decision boundary changes incrementally and slowly. [[MET-NEU], [null]]    \n\nPros:\n+ The paper is written clearly and easy to read[[OAL-POS], [CLA-POS]] \n+ The idea to keep the decision boundary in the low-density region of the target domain makes sense[[PDI-POS], [EMP-POS]] \n+ The both proposed methods seem to be quite easy to implement and incorporate into existing DATNN-based frameworks[[MET-POS], [EMP-POS]] \n+ The combination of VADA and DIRT-T performs better than existing DA algorithms on a range of visual DA benchmarks[[EXP-POS,MET-POS], [EMP-POS]] \n\nCons:\n- Table 1 can be a bit misleading as the performance improvements may be partially attributed to the fact that different methods employ different base NN architectures and different optimizers[[TNF-NEG], [EMP-NEU]] \n- The paper deals exclusively with visual domains; applying the proposed methods to other modalities would make this submission stronger[[MET-NEU], [SUB-NEU]] \n\nOverall, I think it is a good paper and deserves to be accepted to the conference.[[OAL-POS], [APR-POS]]  I\u2019m especially appealed by the fact that the ideas presented in this work, despite being simple, demonstrate excellent performance.[[PDI-POS], [EMP-POS]] \n\nPost-rebuttal revision:\nAfter reading the authors' response to my review, I decided to leave the score as is."[[EXT-NEU], [null]]
