 "This paper proposed an improved version of dynamic coattention networks, which is used for question answering tasks.[[INT-NEU], [null]]  Specifically, there are 2 aspects to improve DCN: one is to use a mixed objective that combines cross entropy with self-critical policy learning, the other one is to imporve DCN with deep residual coattention encoder.[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU]]  The proposed model achieved STOA performance on Stanford Question Asnwering Dataset[[MET-POS], [EMP-POS]]  and several ablation experiments show the effectiveness of these two improvements.[[EXP-POS], [EMP-POS]]  Although DCN+ is an improvement of DCN, I think the improvement is not incremental.[[EXP-NEU,RES-NEG], [EMP-NEU]]  \n\nOne question is that since the model is compicated, will the authors release the source code to repeat all the experimental results?"[[MET-NEU], [null]]
