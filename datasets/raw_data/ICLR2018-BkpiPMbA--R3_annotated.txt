 "The paper presents a new approach to generate adversarial attacks to a neural network, and subsequently present a method to defend a neural network from those attacks.[[INT-NEU], [null]]  I am not familiar with other adversarial attack strategies aside from the ones mentioned in this paper, and therefore I cannot properly assess how innovative the method is.[[EXT-NEU], [null]] \n\nMy comments are the following:\n\n1- I would like to know if benign examples are just regular examples or some short of simple way of computing adversarial attacks.[[EXP-NEU], [EMP-NEU]] \n\n2- I think the authors should provide a more detailed and formal description of the OPTMARGIN method.[[MET-NEU], [SUB-NEU]]  In section 3.2 they explain that \"Our attack uses existing optimization attack techniques to...\", but one should be able to understand the method without reading further references.[[RWK-NEU,MET-NEU], [SUB-NEU]]  Specially a formal representation of the method should be included.[[MET-NEU], [PNF-NEU]] \n\n3- Authors mention that OPTSTRONG attack does not succeed in finding adversarial examples (\"it succeeds on 28% of the samples on MNIST;73% on CIFAR-10\").[[DAT-NEU,MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU]]  What is the meaning of success rate in here? [[DAT-NEU,MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU]] Is it the % of times that the classifier is confused?[[MET-NEU], [CLA-NEU]] \n\n4- OPTSTRONG produces images that are notably more distorted than OPTBRITTLE (by RMS and also visually in the case of MNIST).[[RWK-NEG], [CMP-NEU]]  So I actually cannot tell which method is better, at least in the MNIST experiment.[[RWK-NEU,MET-NEU], [CMP-NEU]]  One could do a method that completely distort the image and therefore will be classified with as a class.[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU]]  But adversarial images should be visually undistinguishable from original images.[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU]]  Generated CIFAR images seem similar than the originals, although CIFAR images are very low resolution, so judging this is hard.[[RWK-NEU,MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU]] \n\n4- As a side note, it would be interesting to have an explanation about why region classification is providing a worse accuracy than point classification for CIFAR-10 benign samples.[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU]] \n\nAs a summary, the authors presented a method that successfully attacks other existing defense methods, and present a method that can successfully defend this attack.[[RWK-NEU,MET-POS], [CMP-POS]]  I would like to see more formal definitions of the methods presented.[[MET-NEU], [SUB-NEU]]  Also, just by looking at RMS it is expected that this method works better than OPTBRITTLE, since the images are more distorted. [[RWK-NEU,MET-NEU], [CMP-POS]] It would be needed to have a way of visually evaluate the similarity between original images and generated images.[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU]]
