 "The paper seems clear enough and original enough.[[INT-POS], [CLA-POS,NOV-POS]]  The idea of jointly forming groups of operations to colocate and figure out placement on devices seems to hold merit.[[PDI-NEU,EXP-NEU,ANA-NEU], [EMP-NEU]]  Where the paper falls short is motivating the problem setting. [[RWK-NEG,PDI-NEG], [IMP-NEG]] Traditionally, for determining optimal execution plans, one may resort to cost-based optimization (e.g., database management systems).[[RWK-NEU,PDI-NEU,EXP-NEU], [EMP-NEU]]  This paper's introduction provides precisely 1 statement to suggest that may not work for deep learning.[[INT-NEU,PDI-NEG,MET-NEG], [IMP-NEG,EMP-NEG]]  Here's the relevant phrase: \"the cost function is typically non-stationary due to the interactions between multiple devices\"[[RWK-NEG,MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG]] . Unfortunately, this statement raises more questions than it answers[[RWK-NEG,PDI-NEG], [null]] . Why are the cost functions non-stationary?[[PDI-NEU,MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU]]  What exactly makes them dynamic?[[PDI-NEU,ANA-NEU], [null]]  Are we talking about a multi-tenancy setting where multiple processes execute on the same device[[RWK-NEU,PDI-NEU,DAT-NEU,EXP-NEU,ANA-NEU], [EMP-NEU]] ? Unlikely, because GPUs are involved.[[PDI-NEG,MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG]]  Without a proper motivation, its difficult to appreciate the methods devised.[[PDI-NEU,MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU]] \n\nPros:\n- Jointly optimizing forming of groups and placing these seems to have merit\[[PDI-NEU,EXP-NEU,ANA-NEU], [IMP-NEU]] n- Experiments show improvements over placement by human \"experts[[PDI-POS,EXP-POS], [EMP-POS]] \"\n- Targets an important problem\n\nCons:\n- Related work seems inadequately referenced[[RWK-POS,PDI-NEG,BIB-NEU], [null]] . There exist other linear/tensor algebra engines/systems that perform such optimization including placing operations on devices in a distributed setting. [[RWK-NEU,EXP-NEU,MET-NEU,ANA-NEU], [IMP-NEG,EMP-NEU]] This paper should at least cite those papers and qualitatively compare against those approaches.[[INT-NEU,RWK-NEU,EXP-NEU], [CMP-NEU,EMP-NEU]]  Here's one reference (others should be easy to find): \"SystemML's Optimizer: Plan Generation for Large-Scale Machine Learning Programs\" by Boehm et al, IEEE Data Engineering Bulletin, 2014.[[RWK-NEU,BIB-NEU], [null]] \n- The methods are not well motivated. [[PDI-POS,MET-POS], [EMP-POS]] There are many approaches to devising optimal execution plans, e.g., rule-based, cost-based, learning-based.[[RWK-NEU,PDI-NEU,MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU]]  In particular, what makes cost-based optimization inapplicable?[[PDI-NEG,MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG]]  Also, please provide some reasoning behind your hypothesis which seems to be that while costs may be dynamic, optimally forming groups and placing them is learn-able.[[PDI-NEG,EXP-NEG,ANA-NEG], [IMP-NEG,EMP-NEG]] \n- The template seems off[[TNF-NEG,OAL-NEG], [PNF-NEG]] . I don't see the usual two lines under the title (\"Anonymous authors\", \"Paper under double-blind review\").[[INT-NEG,RWK-NEG,PDI-NEG,OAL-NEG], [APR-NEG,PNF-NEG]] \n- The title seems misleading. [[PDI-NEG], [APR-NEG]] \".... Device Placement\" seems to suggest that one is placing devices when in fact, the operators are being placed."[[RWK-NEU,PDI-NEU], [null]]
