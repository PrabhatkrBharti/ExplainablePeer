 "Compared to previous studies, this paper mainly claims that the information from larger neighborhoods (more directions or larger distances) will better characterize the relationship between adversarial examples and the DNN model.[[INT-NEU,RWK-NEU,MET-NEU], [CMP-NEU]] \n\nThe idea of employing ensemble of classifiers is smart and effective.[[PDI-POS], [null]]  I am curious about the efficiency of the method.[[RES-NEU,ANA-NEU], [EMP-NEU]] \n\nThe experimental study is extensive.[[EXP-POS], [EMP-POS]]  Results are well discussed with reasonable observations.[[RES-POS], [EMP-POS]]  In addition to examining the effectiveness, authors also performed experiments to explain why OPTMARGIN is superior.[[EXP-POS,MET-NEU], [EMP-POS]]  Authors are suggested to involve more datasets to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.[[DAT-NEU], [SUB-NEU]] \n\nTable 5 is not very clear.[[TNF-NEG], [CLA-NEG]]  Authors are suggested to discuss in more detail.[[TNF-NEU], [EMP-NEU]]
