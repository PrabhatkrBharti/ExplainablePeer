 "This paper presents a model to encode and decode trees in distributed representations.[[MET-NEU], [null]]  \nThis is not the first attempt of doing these encoders and decoders.[[MET-NEG], [NOV-NEG]]  However, there is not a comparative evalution with these methods.[[RWK-NEU,MET-NEU], [NOV-NEU,CMP-NEU]] \nIn fact, it has been demonstrated that it is possible to encode and decode trees in distributed structures without learning parameters, see \"Decoding Distributed Tree Structures\" and \"Distributed tree kernels\".[[RWK-NEU], [CMP-NEU]] \nThe paper should present a comparison with such kinds of models.\n"[[RWK-NEU,MET-NEU], [SUB-NEU]]
