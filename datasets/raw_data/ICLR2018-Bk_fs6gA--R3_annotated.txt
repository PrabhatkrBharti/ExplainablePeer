 "This paper proposes using long term memory to solve combinatorial optimization problems with binary variables.[[INT-NEU,PDI-NEU], [null]]  The authors do not exhibit much knowledge of combinatorial optimization literature (as has been pointed out by other readers) and ignore a lot of previous work by the combinatorial optimization community.[[RWK-NEG,MET-NEG], [SUB-NEG,CMP-NEG]]  In particular, evaluating on random instances is not a good measure of performance,  as has already been pointed out.[[MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG]]  The other issue is with the baseline solver, which also seems to be broken since their solution quality seems extremely poor.[[RES-NEG], [EMP-NEG]]  In light of these issues, I recommend reject."[[OAL-NEG], [REC-NEG]]
