 "This paper gives an empirical estimation of the intrinsic dimensionality of the convolutional neural network VGG19 due to Simonyan and Zisserman.[[INT-NEU], [null]]   To estimate the ID, the authors apply singular value decomposition to the matrix of activation vectors at each of the layers of the network, in which the intrinsic dimension is determined (in a more or less standard way) by the rank at which two consecutive singular values has a ratio exceeding some threshold.[[MET-NEU], [null]]  For the convolutional layers of VGG19, they observe that the sum of IDs for each feature map is roughly equal to the ID of the matrix formed by concatenating the vectors over all feature maps.[[EXP-NEU,MET-NEU], [null]]  They also observe that the ID drops with each successive layer.[[RES-NEU], [null]] \n\nThe authors' findings are intuitively obvious, and certainly not surprising.[[RES-NEG], [EMP-NEG]]  Although a thorough and careful empirical investigation of this phenomenon would be a welcome addition to the research literature, this paper does not yet reach this standard.[[OAL-NEG], [IMP-NEG]]  First and foremost, a result for a single neural network does not constitute enough evidence to justify the authors' conclusions.[[RES-NEG], [SUB-NEG,EMP-NEG]]  Second, the latter half of the paper is concerned with details of the experimental results, without offering any insights as to the implications for deep learning.[[EXP-NEG,RES-NEG], [EMP-NEG]]  Third, the paper is not well presented and organized: the introduction is scant; the notational formulism is not at all clear, rigorous, or consistent; the paper overall lacks polish, with many grammatical errors.[[OAL-NEG], [CLA-NEG,PNF-NEG]]  \n\nOverall, I feel that while this line of research is worthwhile, at this stage the work is not yet ready for publication."[[OAL-NEG], [APR-NEG,REC-NEG]]
