 "The authors introduce the Polar Transformer, a special case of the Spatial Transformer (Jaderberg et al. 2015) that achieves rotation and scale equivariance by using a log-polar sampling grid.[[INT-NEU,PDI-NEU], [null]]  The paper is very well written, easy to follow and substantiates its claims convincingly on variants of MNIST.[[DAT-POS,RES-POS,OAL-POS], [CLA-POS]]  A weakness of the paper is that it does not attempt to solve a real-world problem.[[PDI-NEG], [EMP-NEG]]  However, I think because it is a conceptually novel and potentially very influential idea, it is a valuable contribution as it stands.[[PDI-POS], [NOV-POS]] \n\nIssues:\n\n- The clutter in SIM2MNIST is so small that predicting the polar origin is essentially trivially solved by a low-pass filter.[[DAT-NEG,MET-NEG], [SUB-NEG,EMP-NEG]]  Although this criticism also applies to most previous work using \u2018cluttered\u2019 variants of MNIST, I still think it needs to be considered.[[RWK-NEU,DAT-NEU], [CMP-NEU]]  What happens if predicting the polar origin is not trivial and prone to errors?[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU]]  These presumably lead to catastrophic failure of the post-transformer network, which is likely to be a problem in any real-world scenario.[[RES-NEG], [EMP-NEG]] \n\n- I\u2019m not sure if Section 5.5 strengthens the paper.[[CNT], [CNT]]  Unlike the rest of the paper, it feels very \u2018quick & dirty\u2019 and not very principled.[[OAL-NEG], [PNF-NEG]]  It doesn\u2019t live up to the promise of rotation and scale equivariance in 3D.[[MET-NEG,RES-NEG], [EMP-NEG]]  If I understand it correctly, it\u2019s simply a polar transformer in (x,y) with z maintained as a linear axis and assumed to be parallel to the axis of rotation.[[MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG]]  This means that the promise of rotation and scale equivariance holds up only along (x,y).[[MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG]]  I guess it\u2019s not possible to build full 3D rotation/scale equivariance with the authors\u2019 approach (spherical coordinates probably don\u2019t do the job), but at least the scale equivariance could presumably have been achieved by using log-spaced samples along z and predicting the origin in 3D.[[MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG]]  So instead of showing a quick \u2018hack\u2019, I would have preferred an honest discussion of the limitations and maybe a sketch of a path forward even if no implemented solution is provided.\n"[[RES-NEU,ANA-NEU], [EMP-NEU]]
