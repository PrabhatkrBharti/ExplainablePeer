 "Overall, the idea of this paper is simple but interesting.[[PDI-POS], [null]]  Via performing variational inference in a kind of online manner, one can address continual learning for deep discriminative or generative networks with considerations of model uncertainty.[[INT-NEU], [EMP-NEU]] \n\nThe paper is written well,[[OAL-POS], [CLA-POS]]  and literature review is sufficient.[[RWK-POS], [null]]  My comment is mainly about its importance for large-scale computer vision applications.[[EXP-NEU,MET-NEU], [null]]  The neural networks in the experiments are shallow. \n"[[EXP-NEG], [null]]
