 "In the paper titled \"Faster Discovery of Neural Architectures by Searching for Paths in a Large Model\", the authors proposed an efficient algorithm which can be used for efficient (less resources and time) and faster architecture design for neural networks.[[INT-NEU,MET-POS], [null]]  The motivation of the new algorithm is by sharing parameters across child models in the searching of archtecture.[[MET-NEU], [null]]  The new algorithm is empirically evaluated on two datasets (CIFAR-10 and Penn Treeback);[[DAT-NEU,EXP-NEU], [null]]  --- the new algorithm is 10 times faster and requires only 1/100 resources, and the performance gets worse only slightly.[[MET-POS], [EMP-POS]] \n\nOverall, the paper is well-written.[[OAL-POS], [CLA-POS]]  Although the methodology within the paper appears to be incremental over previous NAS method, the efficiency got improved quite significantly.[[MET-NEU], [EMP-POS]]
