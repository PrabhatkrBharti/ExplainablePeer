 "In this paper the authors give a nice review of clustering methods with deep learning and a systematic taxonomy for existing methods.[[INT-POS,PDI-POS,MET-POS], [EMP-POS]]  Finally, the authors propose a new method by using one unexplored combination of taxonomy features.[[MET-POS], [NOV-POS]] \n\nThe paper is well-written and easy to follow[[OAL-POS], [CLA-POS]] . The proposed combination is straightforward,[[MET-POS], [PNF-POS,EMP-POS]]  but lack of novelty.[[MET-NEG], [NOV-NEG]]  From table 1, it seems that the only differences between the proposed method and DEPICK is whether the method uses balanced assignment and pretraining.[[RWK-NEG,MET-NEG,TNF-NEG], [CMP-NEG,PNF-NEG,EMP-NEG]]  I am not convinced that these changes will lead to a significant difference.[[MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG]]  The performance of the proposed method and DEPICK are also similar in table 1.[[MET-NEG,TNF-NEG], [NOV-NEG,EMP-NEG]]  \n\nIn addition, the experiments section is not comprehensive enough as well the author only tested on two datasets.[[EXP-NEG,ANA-NEG,DAT-NEG], [SUB-NEG,EMP-NEG]]  More datasets should be tested for evaluation.[[DAT-NEG,EXP-NEG], [SUB-NEG]]  In addition, It seems that nearly all the experiments results from comparison methods are borrowed from the original publications.[[RWK-NEG,EXP-NEG,MET-NEG], [NOV-NEG,CMP-NEG,EMP-NEG]]  The authors should finish the experiments on comparison methods and fill the entries in Table 1.\n\n[[EXP-NEG,TNF-NEG], [SUB-NEG,EMP-NEG]] In summary, the proposed method is lack of novelty compare to existing methods.[[RWK-NEG,MET-NEG], [NOV-NEG,CMP-NEG,EMP-NEG]]  The survey part is nice,[[ANA-POS], [null]]  however extensive experiments should be conducted by running existing methods on different datasets and analyzing the pros and cons of the methods and their application scenarios. [[DAT-NEG,EXP-NEG,MET-NEG,ANA-NEG], [SUB-NEG,EMP-NEG]] Therefore, I think the paper cannot be accepted at this stage.\n"[[OAL-NEG], [REC-NEG]]
