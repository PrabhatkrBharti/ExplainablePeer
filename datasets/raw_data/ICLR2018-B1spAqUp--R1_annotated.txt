 "This paper is well written and easy to follow.[[OAL-POS], [CLA-POS,PNF-POS]]  The authors propose pixel deconvolutional layers for convolutional neural networks.[[INT-NEU,PDI-NEU], [null]]  The motivation of the proposed method, PixelDCL, is to remove the checkerboard effect of deconvolutoinal layers.[[PDI-NEU], [null]]  \nThe method consists of adding direct dependencies among the intermediate feature maps generated by the deconv layer. [[MET-NEU], [null]] PixelDCL is applied sequentially, therefore it is slower than the original deconvolutional layer.[[MET-NEG], [CMP-NEG]]  The authors evaluate the model in two different problems: semantic segmentation (on PASCAL VOC and MSCOCO datasets) and in image generation VAE (with the CelebA dataset).[[MET-NEU], [null]]  \n\nThe authors justify the proposed method as a way to alleviate the checkerboard effect (while introducing more complexity to the model and making it slower).[[MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG]]  In the experimental section, however, they do not compare with other approaches to do so For example, the upsampling+conv approach, which has been shown to remove the checkerboard effect while being more efficient than the proposed method (as it does not require any sequential computation).[[MET-NEG], [CMP-NEG]]  Moreover, the PixelDCL does not seem to bring substantial improvements on DeepLab (a state-of-the-art semantic segmentation algorithm). [[MET-NEG,RES-NEG], [EMP-NEG]] More comments and further exploration on this results should be done.[[RES-NEU], [null]]  Why no performance boost?[[RES-NEG], [EMP-NEG]]  Is it because of the residual connection?[[RES-NEU], [EMP-NEU]]  Or other component of DeepLab?[[RES-NEU], [EMP-NEU]]  Is the proposed layer really useful once a powerful model is used?[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU]] \n\nI also think the experiments on VAE are not conclusive.[[EXP-NEG], [EMP-NEG]]  The authors simply show set of generated images.[[TNF-NEU], [EMP-NEU]]  First, it is difficult to see the different of the image generated using deconv and PixelDCL.[[MET-NEG,RES-NEG], [EMP-NEG]]  Second, a set of 20 qualitative images does not (and cannot) validate any research idea."[[RES-NEG], [APR-NEG,EMP-NEG]]
