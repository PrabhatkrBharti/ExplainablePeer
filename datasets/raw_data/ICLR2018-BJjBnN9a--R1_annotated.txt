 "The paper introduces the notion of continuous convolutional neural networks.[[INT-NEU], [null]]  \nThe main idea of the paper is to project examples into an RK Hilbert space\nand performs convolution and filtering into that space.[[PDI-NEU], [null]]  Interestingly, the\nfilters defined in the Hilbert space  have parameters that are learnable.[[PDI-NEU], [null]] \n\nWhile the idea may be novel and interesting,[[PDI-POS], [NOV-POS]]  \nMost data that are available for learning are in discrete forms and hopefully,\nthey have been digitalized according to Shannon theory.[[RWK-NEU,DAT-NEU], [null]]  This means that they bring\nall necessary information for rebuilding their continuous counterpart.[[DAT-POS], [SUB-POS]]  Hence, it is\nnot clear why projecting them back into continuous functions is of interest.[[MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG]]  \n\nAnother point that is not clear or at least misleading is the so-called Hilbert Maps.[[RWK-NEG], [EMP-NEG]] \nAs far as I understand, Equation (4) is not an embedding into an Hilbert space but\nis more a proximity space representation [1].[[RWK-NEG], [EMP-NEG]]  Hence, the learning framework of the\nauthors can be casted more as a learning with similarity function than learning\ninto a RKHS [2].[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU]]  A proper embedding would have mapped $x$ into a function\nbelonging to $\\mH$.[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU]]  In addition, it seems that all computations are done\ninto a \\ell^2 space instead of in the RKHS (equations 5 and 11).[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU]]  \nLearning good similarity functions is also not novel [3] and Equations\n(6) and (7) corresponds to learning these similarity functions.[[MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG]] \nAs far as I remember, there exists also some paper from the nineties that\nlearn the parameters of RBF networks but unfortunately I have not been able to\ngoogle some of them.[[RWK-NEU], [SUB-NEG]] \n\n\nPart 3 is the most interesting part of the paper,[[MET-POS], [EMP-POS]]  however it would have been\ngreat if the authors provide other kernel functions with closed-form convolution \nformula that may be relevant for learning.[[MET-NEG], [SUB-NEG]] \nThe proposed methodology is evaluated on some standard benchmarks in vision.[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU]]  While\nresults are pretty good,[[RES-POS], [EMP-POS]]  it is not clear how the various cluster sets have been obtained\nand what are their influence on the performances (if they are randomly initialized, it \nwould be great to see standard deviation of performances with respect to initializations).[[MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG]] \nI would also be great to have intuitions on why a single continuous filter works betters\nthan 20 discrete ones (if this behaviour is consistent accross initialization).[[MET-NEU], [CMP-NEU]] \n\nOn the overall, while the idea may be of interested,[[PDI-POS], [EMP-POS]]  the paper lacks in motivations\nin connecting to relevant previous works and in providing insights on why it works.[[RWK-NEG,MET-NEG], [CMP-NEG]] \nHowever, performance results seem to be competitive and that's the reader may\nbe eager for insights.[[RES-POS], [EMP-POS]] \n\n\nminor comments\n---------------\n\n* the paper employs vocabulary that is not common in ML.[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU]]  eg. I am not sure what\noccupancy values, or inducing points are.[[CNT], [null]]  \n\n* Supposingly that the authors properly consider computation in RKHS, then \\Sigma_i\nshould be definite positive right?[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU]]  how update in (7) is guaranteed to be DP?[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU]]  \nThis constraints may not be necessary if instead they used proximity space representation.[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU]] \n\n\n\n\n\n[1] https://alex.smola.org/papers/1999/GraHerSchSmo99.pdf\n[2] https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~avrim/Papers/similarity-bbs.pdf\n[3] A.
