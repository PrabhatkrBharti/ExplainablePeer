 "This paper proposes a variant of hierarchical hidden Markov Models (HMMs) where the chains operate at different time-scales with an associate d spectral estimation procedure that is computationally efficient.[[INT-NEU], [null]] \n\nThe model is applied to artificially generated data and to high-frequency equity data showing promising results.[[DAT-NEU,RES-POS], [null]] \n\nThe proposed model and method are reasonably original and novel.[[MET-POS], [NOV-POS]] \n\nThe paper is well written and the method reasonably well explained[[MET-POS,OAL-POS], [CLA-POS]]  (I would add an explanation of the spectral estimation in the Appendix, rather than just citing Rodu et al. 2013).[[BIB-NEU], [REC-POS]] \n\nAdditional experimental results would make it a stronger paper.[[EXP-NEU], [null]] \n\nIt would be great if the authors could include the code that implements the model.[[EXT-NEU], [null]]
