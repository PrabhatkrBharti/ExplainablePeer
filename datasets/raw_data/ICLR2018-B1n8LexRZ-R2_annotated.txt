 "The paper proposed a generalized HMC by modifying the leapfrog integrator using neural networks to make the sampler to converge and mix quickly.[[INT-NEU,MET-NEU], [null]]  Mixing is one of the most challenge problems for a MCMC sampler, particularly when there are many modes in a distribution.[[EXT-NEU], [null]]  The derivations look correct to me.[[MET-POS], [EMP-POS]]  In the experiments, the proposed algorithm was compared to other methods, e.g., A-NICE-MC and HMC.[[EXP-NEU,MET-NEU], [CMP-NEU]]  It showed that the proposed method could mix between the modes in the posterior.[[MET-NEU], [null]]  Although the method could mix well when applied to those particular experiments,[[MET-POS], [EMP-POS]]  it lacks theoretical justifications why the method could mix well.
