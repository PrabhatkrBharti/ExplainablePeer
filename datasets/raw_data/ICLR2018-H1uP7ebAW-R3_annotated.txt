 "Well written and appropriately structured.[[OAL-POS], [CLA-POS,PNF-POS]]  Well within the remit of the conference.[[OAL-NEU], [APR-NEU]] \nNot much technical novelty to be found,[[MET-NEG], [NOV-NEG]]  but the original contributions are adequately identified and they are interesting on their own.[[OAL-POS], [EMP-POS]] \n\nMy main concern (and complaint) is not technical, but application-based.[[RES-NEU], [EMP-NEU]]  This study is (unfortunately) typical in that it focuses on and provides detail of the technical modeling issues, but ignores the medical applicability of the model and results.[[MET-NEG,ANA-NEG], [EMP-NEG]]  This is exemplified by the fact that the data set is hardly described at all and the 14 abnormalities/pathologies, the rationale behind their choice and the possible interrelations and dependencies are never described from a medical viewpoint.[[DAT-NEG,ANA-NEG], [EMP-NEG]]  If I were a medical expert, I would not have a clue about how these results and models could be applied in practice, or about what medical insight I could achieve.[[EXT-NEU], [CNT]] \n\nThe bottom line seems to be: \"my model and approach works better than the other guys' model and approach\", but one is left with the impression that these experiments could have been made with other data, other problems, other fields of application and they would not have not changed much "[[DAT-NEG,EXP-NEU,MET-NEU], [EMP-NEG]]
