 "The authors introduce an algorithm in the subfield of conditional program generation that is able to create programs in a rich java like programming language.[[INT-NEU,PDI-NEU,MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU]]  In this setting, they propose an algorithm based on sketches- abstractions of programs that capture the structure but discard program specific information that is not generalizable such as variable names. [[PDI-NEU,MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU]] Conditioned on information such as type specification or keywords of a method they generate the method's body from the trained sketches.
