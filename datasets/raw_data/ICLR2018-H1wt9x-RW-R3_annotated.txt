 "This paper looks at a specific aspect of the learning-to-teach problem, where the learner is assumed to have a teacher that selects training examples for the student according to a strategy.[[INT-NEU,PDI-NEU], [EMP-NEU]]  The teacher's strategy should also be  learned from data.[[PDI-NEU,DAT-NEU], [EMP-NEU]]   In this case the authors look at finding interpretable teaching strategies.[[RWK-NEU,PDI-NEU], [null]]   The authors define the \"good\" strategies as similar to intuitive strategies (based on human intuition about the structure of the domain) or strategies that are effective for teaching humans.[[PDI-POS], [EMP-POS]]   \nThe suggested method follow an iterative process in which the student and teacher are interchangeably used.[[PDI-NEU], [null]]  At each iteration the teacher generates  examples based on the students current concept.[[RWK-NEU,PDI-NEU], [null]]  \n\nI found it very difficult to follow the claims in the paper.[[PDI-NEG], [IMP-NEG,EMP-NEG]]  Why is it assumed that human intuition is necessarily good? [[PDI-NEU], [null]]  The experiments do not answer these questions, but are designed to show that the suggested approach follows human intuition.[[RWK-NEU,PDI-POS,EXP-NEG], [null]]  There are not enough details to get a good grasp of the suggested method and the different choices for it,  and similarly the experiments are not described in a very convincing way.[[PDI-NEG,EXP-NEG], [IMP-NEG,EMP-NEG]]  Specifically - the domains picked seem very contrived,  there actual results are not reported, the size of the data seems minimal so it's not clear what is actually learned.[[PDI-NEG,RES-NEG], [CLA-NEG,EMP-NEG]] \nHow would you analyze the teaching strategy in realistic cases, where there is no simple intuitive strategy? This would be more convincing."[[PDI-NEU,ANA-NEU], [null]]
