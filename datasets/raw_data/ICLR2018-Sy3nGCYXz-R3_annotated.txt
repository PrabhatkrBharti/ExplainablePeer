 "This paper try to analyze the intrinsic structure of VGG19 and give a new insight of deep neural networks.[[INT-NEU], [null]]  The authors propose to use SVD tools to estimate the dimension of the deep manifolds, and conduct experiments on three categories of ImageNet.[[INT-NEU,DAT-NEU,EXP-NEU,MET-NEU], [null]]  The papers are written well and easy to follow.[[OAL-POS], [CLA-POS]]  The analysis of manifold structure of DNN is important direction, but I am afraid novelty and insight of this work is not enough for acceptance.[[OAL-NEG], [APR-NEG,REC-NEG]] \npros:\n 1. The paper is well written and easy to follow.[[OAL-POS], [CLA-POS]] \n 2. Manifold analysis of the intrinsic structure of DNN is a important direction for further study.[[EXT-NEU], [CNT]] \ncons:\n 1. SVD is a standard tool for subspace and manifold analysis for decades of years.[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU]]  I do not think using it in DNN is a big contribution.[[MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG]] \n2. The authors should explain why choosing VGG19 for analysis.[[MET-NEU,ANA-NEU], [EMP-NEU]]  Do other deep neural networks, such as Resnet, Googlenet, can  have the same phenomenon?[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU]] \n3. Why the authors choose Persian Cat, Container Ship, and Volcano in the experiments?[[EXP-NEU], [EMP-NEU]]  Do other categories have the similar results?[[RES-NEU], [EMP-NEU]] \n4. The authors can indicate the application scenario of this work.[[FWK-NEU], [IMP-NEU]]  For example, this work may guide to design better CNN structure for higher accuracy and lower computation cost.[[ANA-NEU,FWK-NEU], [IMP-NEU]]  It may help the readers better understand the values of this work.\n    "[[OAL-NEU], [IMP-NEU]]
