 "The paper is well-written but is lacking detailed information in some areas (see list of questions).[[OAL-NEU], [CLA-POS]]  The approach of incorporating all the different facts around an entity is worthwhile but pretty straight-forward.[[MET-POS], [EMP-NEU]]  The evaluation part of this paper is hard to assess due to the unavailability of the 2 datasets and appropriate baselines.[[RWK-NEG], [null]]  Therefore, I am currently leaning towards rejecting this paper.[[OAL-NEU], [REC-NEG]] \n\n? p.3: What parts are pre-trained?[[MET-NEU], [null]]  Is e_o fixed for the non-structured knowledge?[[MET-NEU], [null]]  Or is it joint learning and you learn all LSTMs and CNNs yourself? (Besides the reuse of VGG, I could not find this information explicitly stated within the paper.).[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU]]  \n? p.4: The word embeddings for the CNN are pre-trained word2vec/Glove/xyz embeddings?[[MET-NEU], [null]]  How do you deal with words (or even the whole string) for which you have no word embedding?[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU]]  \n? p.6: Do you have one model for all the relations or does every relation has its own LSTM, CNN, feed-forward network?[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU]]  I.e. 1 or 3 feed-forward networks for age, zip code, and release dates?[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU]] \n? p.6: How does \u201cRatings Only\u201d work as DistMult gets no information of the specific entities?[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU]]  Is it just choosing the most common class?[[MET-NEU], [null]] \n? p.7: What does \u201cfind the mid-point of the bin\u201d mean and should it not be 1018 instead of 1000 bins?[[DAT-NEU,MET-NEU], [null]] \n\n+ Insights on how different modalities affect the prediction results.[[RES-NEU], [EMP-NEU]] \n+ The approach is capable of theoretically handling all linked information to an entity as additional information to the link structure[[MET-POS], [EMP-POS]] .\n- As the evaluation data is not available, it is really hard to assess the quality of the models.[[DAT-NEG,MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU]]  No simple baseline like the Unstructured [1] + simple concatenation of an image vector is provided.[[RWK-NEG,TNF-NEU], [PNF-NEU]] \n- Training of CNNs, LSTMs and so on is not clear.(See question regarding whether the models are pre-trained or whether the models are also directly learned from the data.).[[EXP-NEG], [EMP-NEG]] \n\nFurther comments:\n* In Figure 1, the feed-forward network looks like an encoder-decoder network and it does not show the projection from r to R^d which is mentioned in the text.[[TNF-NEG], [PNF-NEG]] \n* The found hyperparameter of the grid-search would also be interesting to know.[[RWK-NEU], [null]] \n\n[1] Bordes, A.; Glorot, X.; Weston, J.; and Bengio, Y. 2012.
