 "This paper proposes to explain the benefits of skip connections in terms of eliminating the singularities of the loss function.[[INT-POS,PDI-POS], [null]]  The discussion is largely based on a sequence of experiments, some of which are interesting and insightful.[[EXP-POS], [null]]  The discussion here can be useful for other researchers.[[FWK-NEU], [IMP-POS]]  \n\nMy main concern is that the result here is purely empirical, with no concrete theoretical justification.[[RES-NEG], [EMP-NEG]]  What the experiments reveal is an empirical correlation between the Eigval index and training accuracy, which can be caused by lots of reasons (and cofounders), and does not necessarily establish a causal relation.[[EXP-NEU], [EMP-NEU]]  Therefore, i found many of the discussion to be questionable.[[EXP-NEU], [CNT]]  I would love to see more solid theoretical discussion to justify the hypothesis proposed in this paper.[[EXP-NEU,ANA-NEU], [SUB-NEU]] \n \nDo you have a sense how accurate is the estimation of the tail probabilities of the eigenvalues?[[RES-NEU], [EMP-NEU]]  Because the whole paper is based on the approximation of the eigval indexes, it is critical to exam the estimation is accurate enough to draw the conclusions in the paper.[[MET-NEG,RES-NEG], [EMP-NEG]]  \n\nAll the conclusions are based on one or two datasets.[[DAT-NEU], [SUB-NEU]]  Could you consider testing the result on more different datasets to verify if the results are generalizable?
