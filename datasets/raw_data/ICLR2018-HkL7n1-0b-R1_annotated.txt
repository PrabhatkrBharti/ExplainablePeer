 "This paper satisfies the following necessary conditions for\nacceptance.[[OAL-NEU], [REC-NEU]]  The writing is clear and I was able to understand the\npresented method (and its motivation) despite not being too familiar\nwith the relevant literature. [[RWK-NEG,MET-NEG], [CLA-POS,EMP-NEG]] Explicitly writing the auto-encoder(s)\nas pseudo-code algorithms was particular helpful.[[RWK-NEU,MET-POS], [CLA-POS,EMP-POS]]  I found no technical\nerrors.[[OAL-POS], [EMP-POS]]  The problem addressed is one worth solving - building a\ngenerative model of observed data.[[PDI-NEG,DAT-NEU], [EMP-NEG]]  There is some empirical testing\nwhich show the presented method in a good light.[[RWK-NEU,MET-NEU], [SUB-NEG,EMP-NEU]] \n\nThe authors are careful to relate the presented method with existing\nones, most notably VAE and AAE.[[RWK-NEU,MET-NEU], [null]]  I suppose one could argue that the\nclose connection to existing methods means that this paper is not\ninnovative enough.[[RWK-NEG,MET-NEG], [SUB-NEG]]  I think that would be unfair - most new methods\nhave close relations with existing ones - it is just that sometimes\nthe authors do not flag this up as they should.[[RWK-NEG], [EMP-NEG]] \n\nWAE is a bit oversold.[[RWK-NEG], [null]]  The authors state that WAE generates \"samples\nof better quality\" (than VAE) without any condition being put on when\nit does this.[[PDI-NEU], [EMP-NEU]]  There is no proof that it is always better, and I can't\nsee how there could be.[[RWK-NEG], [SUB-NEG,EMP-NEG]]  Any method of inferring a generative model\nfrom data must make some 'inductive' assumptions.[[RWK-NEU,DAT-NEU,MET-NEU], [null]]  Surely one could\ndevise situations where VAE outperforms WAE.[[PDI-NEU], [null]]  I think this issue should\nhave been examined in more depth.[[PDI-NEG], [SUB-NEG,EMP-NEG]] \n\nI found no typo or grammatical errors which is unusual - good careful\njob[[OAL-NEU], [PNF-NEU]]
