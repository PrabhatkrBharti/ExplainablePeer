 "This paper introduces a number of different techniques for improving exploration in deep Q learning.[[INT-NEU], [null]]  The main technique is to use UCB (upper confidence bound) to speedup exploration.[[MET-NEU], [null]]  The authors also introduces \"Ensemble voting\" facilitate exploitation[[MET-NEU], [null]] .\n\nThis paper shows improvement over baselines.[[RWK-POS], [CMP-POS]]  But does not seem to offer significant insight or dramatic improvement.[[RWK-NEG], [IMP-NEG,CMP-NEG]]  The techniques introduced are a small permutation of previous results.[[MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG]]  The baselines are not particularly strong either.[[RWK-NEG], [null]] \n\nThe paper appeared to have be rushed. The presentation is not always clear.[[OAL-NEG], [PNF-NEG]] \n\nI also have the following questions I hope the authors could help me with:\n\n1. I failed to understand how Eqn (5). Could you please clarify.[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU]] \n\n2. What is the significance of the math introduced in section 3? All that was proposed was: (1) Majority voting, (2) UCB exploration.[[EXP-NEU,MET-NEU], [EMP-NEG]] \n\n3. Why comparing to A3C+ which is not necessarily better than A3C in final performance?[[MET-NEU], [CMP-NEU]] \n\n4. Why not comparing to Bootstrapped DQN since the proposed method is based on it?[[MET-NEU], [CMP-NEG]] \n\n5. Why is the proposed method better than Bootstrapped DQN, since UCB does not necessarily outperform Thompson sampling in the case of bandits?[[MET-NEU], [CMP-NEU,EMP-NEU]] \n\n6. If there is a section on INFOGAIN exploration, why not mention it in the main text?"[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU]]
