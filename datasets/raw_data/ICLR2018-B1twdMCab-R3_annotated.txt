 "The quality of this paper is good.[[OAL-POS], [CLA-POS]]  The presentation is clear [[OAL-POS], [PNF-POS]] but I find lack of description of a key topic.[[OAL-NEG], [SUB-NEG]]  The proposed model is not very innovative but works fine for the DQA task.[[MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG]]  For the TE task, the proposed method does not perform better than the state-of-the-art systems.[[RWK-NEG,MET-NEG], [CMP-NEG]]  \n\n- As ESIM is one of the key components in the experiments, you should briefly introduce ESIM and explain how you incorporated with your vector representations into ESIM.[[EXP-NEG,ANA-NEG], [SUB-NEG,EMP-NEG]] \n- The reference of ESIM is not correct.[[MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG]] \n- Figure 1 is hard to understand.[[TNF-NEG], [PNF-NEG]]  \n- What corpus did you use to pre-train word vectors?[[DAT-NEU], [EMP-NEU]]  \n- As the proposed method was successful for the QA task,[[MET-POS], [EMP-POS]]  you need to explain QA data sets and how the questions are solved.[[DAT-NEG,MET-NEG], [SUB-NEG]] \n- I also expect performance and  error analysis of the task results.[[RES-NEG,ANA-NEG], [SUB-NEG]]   \n- To claim \"task-agnostic\", you need to try to apply your method to other NLP tasks as well.[[MET-NEU], [SUB-NEU,EMP-NEU]] \n- Page 3. \\Sigma is not defined."[[MET-NEG], [SUB-NEG]]
