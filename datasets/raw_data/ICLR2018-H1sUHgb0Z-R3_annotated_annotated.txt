 "The authors proposed a supervised learning algorithm for modeling label and worker quality. [[INT-NEU], [null]] Further utilize it to study one of the important problems in crowdsourcing - How much redundancy is required in crowdsourcing and whether low redundancy with abundant noise examples lead to better labels.[[PDI-POS], [null]] \n\nOverall the paper was well written.[[OAL-POS], [CLA-POS]]  The motivation of the work is clearly explained and supported with relevant related work.[[RWK-POS,PDI-POS], [null]]  The main contribution of the paper is in the bootstrapping algorithm which models the worker quality and labels in an iterative fashion.[[MET-POS], [null]]  Though limited to binary classification, the paper proposed a theoretical framework extending the existing work on VC dimension to compute the upper bound on the risk.[[MET-NEU], [EMP-POS]]  The authors also showed theoretically and empirically on synthetic data sets that the low redundancy and larger set of labels in crowdsourcing gives better results.[[DAT-NEU,MET-POS,RES-POS], [EMP-POS]]  \n\nMore detailed comments\n1. Instead of considering multi-class classification as one-vs-all binary classification, can you extend the theoretical guarantee on the risk to multi-class set up like Softmax which is widely used in research nowadays.[[RWK-NEU,MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU]] \n2. Can you introduce the Risk -R in the paper before using it in Theorem 4.1\n3[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU]] . Is there any limit on how many examples each worker has to label?[[MET-NEU], [SUB-NEU]]  Can you comment more on how to pick that value in real-world settings? Just saying sufficiently many (Section 4.2) is not sufficient.[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU]] \n4. Under the experiments, different variations of Majority Vote, EM and Oracle correction were used as baselines.[[EXP-NEU], [null]]  Can you cite the references and also add some existing state-of-the-art techniques mentioned in the related work section.[[RWK-POS], [SUB-POS]] \n5. For the experiments on synthetic datasets, workers are randomly sampled with replacements. Were the scores reported based on average of multiple runs.[[EXP-NEU], [EMP-NEU]]  If yes, can you please report the error bars.[[EXP-NEU,ANA-NEU], [EMP-NEU]] \n6. For the MS-COCO, examples can you provide more detailed results as shown for synthetic datasets? Majority vote is a very weak baseline.[[RES-NEU,ANA-NEU], [EMP-NEU]]  \n\nFor the novel approach and the theoretical backing, I consider the paper to be a good one.[[OAL-POS], [NOV-POS,EMP-POS]]  The paper has scope for improvement.[[OAL-NEU], [EMP-NEU]]
