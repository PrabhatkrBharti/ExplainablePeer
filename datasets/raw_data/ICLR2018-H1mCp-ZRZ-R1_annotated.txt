 "In this work, the authors suggest the use of control variate schemes for estimating gradient values, within a reinforcement learning  framework.[[INT-NEU], [null]]  The authors also introduce a specific control variate technique based on the so-called Stein\u2019s identity.[[MET-POS], [null]]  The paper is interesting and well-written.[[OAL-POS], [CLA-POS]] \n\nI have some question and some consideration that can be useful for improving the appealing of the paper.[[OAL-POS], [null]] \n\n- I believe that different Monte Carlo (or Quasi-Monte Carlo) strategies can be applied in order to estimate the integral (expected value) in Eq. (1), as also suggested in this work.[[MET-NEU], [null]]  Are there other alternatives in the literature?[[MET-NEU], [null]]  Please, please discuss and cite some papers if required.[[RWK-NEU,BIB-NEU], [CMP-NEU]]   \n\n- I suggest to divide Section 3.1 in two subsections. The first one introducing Stein\u2019s identity and the related comments that you need, and a second one, starting after Theorem 3.1, with title \u201cStein Control Variate\u201d.[[MET-NEU], [SUB-NEU]] \n\n-  Please also discuss the relationships, connections, and possible applications of your technique to other algorithms used in Bayesian optimization, active learning and/or sequential learning, for instance as\n\nM.[[RWK-NEU,MET-NEU,FWK-NEU], [IMP-NEU]]  U.
