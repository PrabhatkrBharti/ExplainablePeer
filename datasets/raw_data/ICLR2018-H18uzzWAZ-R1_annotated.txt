 "The paper discusses a method for adjusting image embeddings in order tease apart technical variation from biological signal.[[INT-NEU,PDI-NEU,MET-NEU], [null]]  A loss function based on the Wasserstein distance is used. \nThe paper is interesting[[OAL-POS], [CNT]]  but could certainly do with more explanations.[[OAL-NEG], [EMP-NEG]]  \n\nComments:\n1. It is difficult for the reader to understand a) why Wasserstein is used "[[MET-NEG], [SUB-NEG]] and b) how exactly the nuisance variation is reduced."[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU]] \nA dedicated section on motivation is missing.`[[OAL-NEG], [SUB-NEG]] \n\n2. Does the Deep Metric network always return a '64-dim' vector?[[EXP-NEU,MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU]]  \nHave you checked your model using different length vectors?[[EXP-NEU,MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU]]  \n\n3. Label the y-axis in Fig 2.[[TNF-NEG], [PNF-NEG]] \n\n4. The fact that you have early-stopping as opposed to a principled regularizer also requires further substantiation.
