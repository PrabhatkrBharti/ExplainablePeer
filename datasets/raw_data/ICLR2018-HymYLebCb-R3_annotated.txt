 "This paper views graph classification as image classification, and shows that the CNN model adapted from image net can be effectively adapted to the graph classification.[[PDI-NEU,MET-NEU], [null]]  The idea is interesting and the result looks promising,[[PDI-POS,RES-POS], [EMP-POS]]  but I do not understand the intuition behind the success of analogizing graph with images.[[MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG]] \n\nFundamentally, a convolutional filter stands for a operation within a small neighborhood on the image.[[MET-NEU], [null]]  However, it is unclear how it means for the graph representation.[[MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG]]  Is the neighborhood predefined?[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU]]  Are the graph nodes pre-ordered? [[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU]] \n\nI am also curious with the effect of pre-trained model from ImageNet.[[DAT-NEU,MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU]]  Since the graph presentation does not use color channels,  pre-trained model is used different from what it was designed to.[[TNF-NEG], [PNF-NEG]]  I would imagine the benefit of using ImageNet is just to bring a random, high-dimensional embedding.[[DAT-NEU], [EMP-NEU]]   In addition, I wonder whether it will help to fine-tune the model on the graph classification data.[[MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG]]  Could this submission show some fine-tune experiments?"[[EXP-NEU], [EMP-NEU]]
