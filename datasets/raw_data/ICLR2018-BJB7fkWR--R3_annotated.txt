 "- This paper discusses an agent architecture which uses a shared representation to train multiple tasks with different sprite level visual statistics.[[INT-NEU,PDI-NEU,MET-NEU], [null]]  The key idea is that the agent learns a shared representations for tasks with different visual statistics[[PDI-NEU,RES-NEU], [null]] \n\n- A lot of important references  touching on very similar ideas are missing.[[BIB-NEG], [SUB-NEG]]  For e.g. \"Unsupervised Pixel-level Domain Adaptation with Generative Adversarial Networks\", \"Using Simulation and Domain Adaptation to Improve Efficiency of Deep Robotic Grasping\", \"Schema Networks: Zero-shot Transfer with a Generative Causal Model of Intuitive Physics\".[[BIB-NEU], [SUB-NEU]]  \n\n- This paper has a lot of orthogonal details.[[OAL-NEU], [SUB-NEU]]  For instance sec 2.1 reviews the history of games and AI, which is besides the key point and does not provide any literary context.[[MET-NEU], [SUB-NEU]]  \n\n- Only single runs for the results are shown in plots.[[RES-NEU], [SUB-NEU]]  How statistically valid are the results?[[RES-NEU], [EMP-NEU]] \n\n- In the last section authors mention the intent to do future work on atari and other env.[[FWK-NEU], [IMP-NEU]]  Given that this general idea has been discussed in the literature several times, it seems imperative to at least scale up the experiments before the paper is ready for publication"[[EXP-NEU], [APR-NEU,EMP-NEU]]
