 "The parameterized clipping activation (PACT) idea is very clear: extend clipping activation by learning the clipping parameter.[[PDI-POS], [null]]  Then,  PACT is combined with quantizing the activations.[[MET-NEU], [null]]  \n\nThe proposed technique sounds.[[MET-POS], [null]]  The performance improvement is expected and validated by experiments.[[EXP-POS], [IMP-POS]]  \n\nBut I am not sure if the novelty is strong enough for an ICLR paper. \n"[[PDI-NEU], [APR-NEU,NOV-NEU]]
