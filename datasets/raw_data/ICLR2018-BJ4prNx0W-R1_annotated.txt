 "Quality\nThe paper is well-written and clear, and includes relevant comparisons to previous work (NPI and recursive NPI).[[RWK-POS,OAL-POS], [CLA-POS,CMP-POS]] \n\nClarity\nThe paper is clearly written.[[OAL-POS], [CLA-POS]] \n\nOriginality\nTo my knowledge the method proposed in this work is novel.[[MET-POS], [NOV-POS]]  It is the first to study constructing minimal training sets for NPI given a black-box oracle.[[PDI-POS,MET-POS], [NOV-POS]]  However, as pointed out by the authors, there is a lot of similar prior work in software testing.[[RWK-NEU], [CMP-NEU]] \n\nSignificance\nThe work could be potentially significant,[[FWK-POS], [IMP-POS]]  but there are some very strong assumptions made in the paper that could limit the impact.[[FWK-NEG], [IMP-NEG]]  If the NPI has access to a black-box oracle, it is not clear what is the use of training an NPI in the first place.[[MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG]]  It would be very helpful to describe a potential scenario where the proposed approach could be useful.[[MET-NEU], [SUB-NEU]]  Also, it is assumed that the number of possible inputs is finite (also true for the recursive NPI paper), and it is not clear what techniques or lessons of this paper might transfer to tasks with perceptual inputs.[[MET-NEG,ANA-NEG], [SUB-NEG,EMP-NEG]]  The main technical contribution is the search procedure to find minimal training sets and pare down the observation size, and the empirical validation of the idea on several algorithmic tasks.[[DAT-NEU,MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU]] \n\nPros\n- Greatly improves the data efficiency of recursive NPI.[[DAT-POS,MET-POS,RES-POS], [EMP-POS]] \n- Training and verification sets are automatically generated by the proposed method.[[DAT-POS,MET-POS,RES-POS], [EMP-POS]] \n\nCons\n- Requires access to a black-box oracle to construct the dataset.[[DAT-NEU,MET-NEU], [SUB-NEU]] \n- Not clear that the idea will be useful in more complex domains with unbounded inputs.\n"[[PDI-NEG,MET-NEG], [IMP-NEG]]
