 "1) This paper proposes a method for learning the sentence representations with sentences dependencies information.[[INT-NEU], [null]]  It is more like a dependency-based version skip-thought on the sentence level.[[PDI-NEU], [EMP-NEU]]  The idea is interesting to me, but I think this paper still needs some improvements.[[OAL-NEU], [null]]  The introduction and related work part are clear with strong motivations to me.[[INT-POS,RWK-POS], [CNT]]  But section 4 and 6 need a lot of details. [[CNT], [CNT]] \n\n2) My comments are as follows:\ni) this paper claims that this is a general sentence embedding method, however, from what has been described in section 3, I think this dependency is only defined in HTML format document.[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU]]  What if I only have pure text document without these HTML structure information?[[EXP-NEU,MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU]]  So I suggest the authors do not claim that this method is a \"general-purpose\" sentence embedding model.[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU]] \n\nii) The authors do not have any descriptions for Figure 3.  Equation 1 is also very confusing.[[TNF-NEG], [null]] \n\niii) The experiments are insufficient in terms of details. How is the loss calculated? How is the detection accuracy calculated?[[EXP-NEG], [null]]
