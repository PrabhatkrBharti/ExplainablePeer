 "# Summary\nThis paper introduces a new prediction problem where the model should predict the hidden opponent's state as well as the agent's state.[[INT-NEU,PDI-NEU], [null]]  This paper presents a neural network architecture which takes the map information and several other features and reconstructs the unit occupancy and count information in the map.[[INT-NEU,PDI-NEU], [null]]  The result shows that the proposed method performs better than several hand-designed baselines on two downstream prediction tasks in Starcraft.[[MET-POS,RES-POS], [EMP-POS]] \n\n[Pros]\n- Interesting problem[[PDI-POS], [EMP-POS]] \n\n[Cons]\n- The proposed method is not much novel.[[MET-NEG], [NOV-NEG]] \n- The evaluation is a bit limited to two specific downstream prediction tasks.[[MET-NEG], [SUB-NEG]] \n\n# Novelty and Significance\n- The problem considered in this paper is interesting.[[PDI-POS], [EMP-POS]] \n- The proposed method is not much novel.[[MET-NEG], [NOV-NEG]]  \n- Overall, this paper is too specific to Starcraft domain + particular downstream prediction tasks.[[OAL-NEU], [CNT]]  It would be much stronger to show the benefit of defogging objective on the actual gameplay rather than prediction tasks.[[ANA-NEU], [SUB-NEU]]  Alternatively, it could be also interesting to consider an RL problem where the agent should reveal the hidden state of the opponent as much/quickly as possible.[[ANA-NEU], [SUB-NEU]] \n\n# Quality\n- The experimental result is not much comprehensive.[[EXP-NEG,RES-NEG], [EMP-NEG]]  The proposed method is expected to perform better than hand-designed methods on downstream prediction tasks.[[ANA-NEU], [EMP-NEU]]  It would be better to show an in-depth analysis of the learned model or show more results on different tasks (possibly RL tasks rather than prediction tasks).[[ANA-NEU], [SUB-NEU]] \n\n# Clarity\n- I did not fully understand the learning objective.[[MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG]]  Does the model try to reconstruct the state of the current time-step or the future?[[RWK-NEU,MET-NEU,FWK-NEU], [IMP-NEU]]  The learning objective is not clearly defined.[[MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG]]  In Section 4.1, the target x and y have time steps from t1 to t2.[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU]]  What is the range of t1 and t2?[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU]]  If the proposed model is doing future prediction, it would be important to show and discuss long-term prediction results."[[MET-NEU,RES-NEU,FWK-NEU], [IMP-NEU]]
