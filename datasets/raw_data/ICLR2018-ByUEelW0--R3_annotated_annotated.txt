 "Summary: This paper introduces a model that combines the rotation matrices with the LSTMs.[[INT-NEU], [null]]  They apply the rotations before the final tanh activation of the LSTM and before applying the output gate.[[MET-NEU], [null]]  The rotation matrix is a block-diagonal one where each block is a 2x2 rotations and those rotations are parametrized by another neural network that predicts the angle of the rotations.[[MET-NEU], [null]]  The paper only provides results on the bAbI task.[[EXP-NEU,RES-NEU], [null]]  \n\nQuestions:\nHave you compared against to the other parametrizations of the LSTMs and rotation matrices? (ablation study)[[EXP-NEU], [CMP-NEU]] \nHave you tried on other tasks?[[EXP-NEU], [null]] \nWhy did you just apply the rotations only on d_{t}.[[EXP-NEU,MET-NEU], [null]] \n\nPros:\nUses a simple parametrization of the rotation matrices.[[MET-POS], [EMP-POS]] \n\nCons:\nNot clear justification and motivations[[PDI-NEU,MET-NEG], [CLA-NEG,NOV-NEU]] \nThe experiments are really lacking:\nNo ablation study[[EXP-NEG], [EMP-NEG]] \nThe results are only limited to single toy task.[[EXP-NEU,RES-NEU], [EMP-NEU]] \n\n\nGeneral Comments:\n\nThis paper proposes to use the rotation matrices with LSTMs. [[MET-NEU], [null]] However there is no clear justification why is this particular parametrization of rotation matrix is being used over others and why is it only applied before the output gate.[[MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG]]  The experiments are seriously lacking, an ablation study should have been made and the results are not good enough. [[EXP-NEG,RES-NEG], [EMP-NEG]] The experiments are only limited to bAbI task which doesn\u2019t tell you much.[[EXP-NEU], [SUB-NEG]]  This paper is not ready for publication, and really feels like it is rushed.[[OAL-NEG], [REC-NEG]] \n\nMinor Comment:\nThis paper needs more proper proof-reading.[[OAL-NEU], [CLA-NEU]]  There are some typos in it, e.g.:\n1st page, senstence --> sentence\n4th page, the the ...[[OAL-NEG], [CLA-NEG]]
