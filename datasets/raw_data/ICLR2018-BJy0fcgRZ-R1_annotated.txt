 "Quality\n\nThis paper demonstrates that human category representations can be inferred by sampling deep feature spaces.[[INT-NEU,PDI-NEU], [null]]  The idea is an extension of the earlier developed MCMC with people approach where samples are drawn in the latent space of a DCGAN and a BiGAN.[[RWK-NEU,PDI-NEU], [CMP-NEU]]  The approach is thoroughly validated using two online behavioural experiments.[[EXP-POS,MET-POS], [EMP-POS]] \n\nClarity\n\nThe rationale is clear and the results are straightforward to interpret.[[RES-POS], [CLA-POS,EMP-POS]]  In Section 4.2.1 statements on resemblance and closeness to mean faces could be tested.[[EXP-NEU], [SUB-NEU]]  Last sentences on page 7 are hard to parse.[[EXP-NEG], [EMP-NEG]]  The final sentence probably relates back to the CI approach.[[RWK-NEU], [CMP-NEU]]  A few typos.\n\nOriginality\n\nThe approach is a straightforward extension of the MCMCP approach using generative models.[[RWK-NEU,MET-POS], [NOV-NEU,CMP-NEU]] \n\nSignificance \n\nThe approach improves on previous category estimation approaches by embracing the expressiveness of recent generative models.[[RWK-POS,MET-POS], [CMP-POS]]  Extensive experiments demonstrate the usefulness of the approach.[[EXP-POS,MET-POS], [EMP-POS]] \n\nPros\n\nUseful extension of an important technique backed up by behavioural experiments.[[EXP-POS,MET-POS], [EMP-POS]] \n\nCons\n\nDoes not provide new theory but combines existing ideas in a new manner."[[OAL-NEG], [NOV-NEG]]
