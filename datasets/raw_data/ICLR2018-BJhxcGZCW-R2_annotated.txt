 "The authors suggest using a variational autoencoder to infer binary relationships between medical entities.[[MET-NEU], [null]]  The model is quite simple and intuitive and the authors demonstrate that it can generate meaningful relationships between pairs of entities that were not observed before.[[MET-POS], [EMP-POS]]   \nWhile the paper is very well-written[[OAL-POS], [CLA-POS]]  I have certain concerns regarding the motivation, model, and evaluation methodology followed:[[PDI-NEG,MET-NEG], [null]] \n\n1) A stronger motivation for this model is required.[[MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG]]  Having a generative model for causal relationships between symptoms and diseases is \"intriguing\" yet I am really struggling with the motivation of getting such a model from word co-occurences in a medical corpus.[[DAT-NEG,MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG]]  I can totally buy the use of the proposed model as means to generate additional training data for a discriminative model used for information extraction but the authors need to do a better job at explaining the downstream applications of their model.[[DAT-NEU,EXP-NEG,MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG]]  \n\n2) The word embeddings used seem to be sufficient to capture the \"knowledge\" included in the corpus.[[DAT-POS,MET-POS], [EMP-POS]]  An ablation study of the impact of word embeddings on this model is required.[[ANA-NEG], [SUB-NEG]]  \n\n3) The authors do not describe how the data from xywy.com were annotated.[[DAT-NEG], [SUB-NEG]]  Were they annotated by experts in the medical domain or random users?[[DAT-NEG], [EMP-NEG]] \n\n4) The metric of quality is particularly ad-hoc.[[RES-NEG], [EMP-NEG]]
