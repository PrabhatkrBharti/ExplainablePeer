 "This paper gives an elaboration on the Gated Attention Reader (GAR) adding gates based on answer elimination in multiple choice reading comprehension.[[INT-NEU,PDI-NEU], [null]]   I found the formal presentation of the model reasonably clear the the empirical evaluation reasonably compelling.[[EXP-POS], [PNF-POS,EMP-POS]] \n\nIn my opinion the main weakness of the paper is the focus on the RACE dataset.[[DAT-NEG], [EMP-NEG]]   This dataset has not attracted much attention and most work in reading comprehension has now moved to the SQUAD dataset for which there is an active leader board.[[DAT-NEG], [SUB-NEG]]   I realize that SQUAD is not explicitly multiple choice and that this is a challenge for an answer elimination architecture.[[DAT-NEG], [EMP-NEG]]   However, it seems that answer elimination might be applied to each choice of the initial position of a possible answer span. [[MET-NEU,RES-NEU], [EMP-NEU]]  In any case, competing with an active leader board would be much more compelling."[[RES-NEU], [IMP-NEU]]
