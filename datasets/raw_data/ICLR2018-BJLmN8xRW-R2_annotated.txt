 "This paper applies several NN architectures to classify url\u2019s between benign and malware related URLs.[[INT-NEU,PDI-NEU], [null]] \nThe baseline is random forests and feature engineering.[[RWK-NEU], [null]] \n\nThis is clearly an application paper.[[OAL-NEU], [APR-NEU]]  \nNo new method is being proposed, only existing methods are applied directly to the task.[[MET-NEG], [NOV-NEG]] \n\nI am not familiar with the task at hand so I cannot properly judge the quality/accuracy of the results obtained but it seems ok.[[EXT-NEU], [null]] \nFor evaluation data was split randomly in 80% train, 10% test and 10% validation.[[DAT-NEU,MET-NEU], [null]]  Given the amount of data 2*10**6 samples, this seems sufficient.[[DAT-POS], [EMP-POS]] \nI think the evaluation could be improved by using malware URLs that were obtained during a larger time window.[[MET-NEG], [EMP-NEG]] \nSpecifically, it would be nice if train, test and validation URLs would be operated chronologically. I.e. all train url precede the validation and test urls.[[EXP-NEU,MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU]] \nIdeally, the train and test urls would also be different in time.[[EXP-NEU], [EMP-NEU]]  This would enable a better test of the generalization capabilities in what is essentially a continuously changing environment.[[EXP-NEU], [EMP-NEU]]  \n\nThis paper is a very difficult for me to assign a final rating.[[OAL-NEG], [REC-NEG]] \nThere is no obvious technical mistake  and the paper is written reasonably well.[[OAL-POS], [CLA-POS]] \nThere is however a lack of technical novelty or insight in the models themselves.[[MET-NEG], [NOV-NEG]]  \nI think that the paper should be submitted to a journal or conference in the application domain where it would be a better fit.[[OAL-NEG], [APR-NEG]] \n\nFor this reason, I will give the score marginally below the acceptance threshold now.[[OAL-NEG], [REC-NEG]] \nBut if the other reviewers argue that the paper should be accepted I will change my score.\n\n"[[EXT-NEU], [null]]
