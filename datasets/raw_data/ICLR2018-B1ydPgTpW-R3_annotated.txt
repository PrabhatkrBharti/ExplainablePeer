 "The authors present a deep neural network that evaluates plate numbers.[[INT-NEU,MET-NEU], [null]]  The relevance of this problem is that there are auctions for plate numbers in Hong Kong, and predicting their value is a sensible activity in that context. [[PDI-POS,EXT-NEU], [null]] I find that the description of the applied problem is quite interesting; in fact overall the paper is well written and very easy to follow.[[PDI-POS,OAL-POS], [CLA-POS]]  There are some typos and grammatical problems (indicated below),[[OAL-NEG], [CLA-NEG]]  but nothing really serious.[[OAL-NEU], [CLA-NEU]] \n\nSo, the paper is relevant and well presented.[[OAL-POS], [PNF-POS]]  However, I find that the proposed solution is an application of existing techniques, so it lacks on novelty and originality.[[RWK-NEG], [NOV-NEG,CMP-NEG]]  Even though the significance of the work is apparent given the good results of the proposed neural network,[[RES-POS,OAL-POS], [IMP-POS]]  I believe that such material is more appropriate to a focused applied meeting.[[OAL-NEU], [APR-NEU]]  However, even for that sort of setting I think the paper requires some additional work, as some final parts of the paper have not been tested yet (the interesting part of explanations).[[ANA-NEG], [SUB-NEG]]  Hence I don't think the submission is ready for publication at this moment.[[OAL-NEG], [APR-NEG,REC-NEG]] \n\nConcerning the text, some questions/suggestions:\n- Abstract, line 1: I suppose \"In the Chinese society...\"--- are there many Chinese societies?[[ABS-NEU], [PNF-NEU]] \n- The references are not properly formatted; they should appear at (XXX YYY) but appear as XXX (YYY) in many cases, mixed with the main text.[[BIB-NEG], [PNF-NEG]]  \n- Footnote 1, line 2: \"an exchange\".[[ABS-NEU], [PNF-NEU]] \n- Page 2, line 12: \"prices.[[OAL-NEU], [PNF-NEG]]  Among\".\n- Please add commas/periods at the end of equations.[[MET-NEU], [PNF-NEU]] \n- There are problems with capitalization in the references.
