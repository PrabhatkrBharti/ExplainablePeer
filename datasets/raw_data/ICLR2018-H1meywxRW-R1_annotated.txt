 "Summary:\nThis paper proposed an extension of the dynamic coattention network (DCN) with deeper residual layers and self-attention.[[INT-NEU], [null]]  It also introduced a mixed objective with self-critical policy learning to encourage predictions with high word overlap with the gold answer span.[[MET-NEU], [EMP-NEU]]  The resulting DCN+ model achieved significant improvement over DCN.[[RES-POS], [EMP-POS]] \n\nStrengths:\nThe model and the mixed objective is well-motivated and clearly explained.\nNear state-of-the-art performance on SQuAD dataset (according to the SQuAD leaderboard).[[DAT-POS,MET-POS], [EMP-POS]] \n\nOther questions and comments:\nThe ablation shows 0.7 improvement on EM with mixed objective.[[MET-POS,RES-POS], [EMP-POS]]  It is interesting that the mixed objective (which targets F1) also brings improvement on EM. \n"[[RES-POS], [null]]
