Summary\n - This paper mainly focuses on a counting problem in visual question answering (VQA) using attention mechanism.  The authors propose a differentiable counting component, which explicitly counts the number of objects.  Given attention weights and corresponding proposals, the model deduplicates overlapping proposals by eliminating intra-object edges and inter-object edges using graph representation for proposals.  In experiments, the effectiveness of proposed model is clearly shown in counting questions on both a synthetic toy dataset and the widely used VQA v2 dataset. \n\nStrengths\n - The proposed model begins with reasonable motivation and shows its effectiveness in experiments clearly.  \n - The architecture of the proposed model looks natural and all components seem to have clear contribution to the model. \n - The proposed model can be easily applied to any VQA model using soft attention.  \n - The paper is well written and the contribution is clear. \n\nWeaknesses\n - Although the proposed model is helpful to model counting information in VQA,  it fails to show improvement with respect to a couple of important baselines: prediction from image representation only and from the combination of image representation and attention weights. \n\nComments\n - It is not clear if the value of count \"c\" is same with the final answer in counting questions. \n\n[[CLA-POS],[JUS-POS],[DEP-POS],[FAI-POS],[CON-POS],[ENG-NEG],[ACC-POS],[CST-POS],[NOV-POS],[ETH-NEG]]
