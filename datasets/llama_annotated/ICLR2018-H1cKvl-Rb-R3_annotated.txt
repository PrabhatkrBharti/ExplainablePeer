This paper introduces a number of different techniques for improving exploration in deep Q learning.  The main technique is to use UCB (upper confidence bound) to speedup exploration.  The authors also introduces \"Ensemble voting\" facilitate exploitation .\n\nThis paper shows improvement over baselines.  But does not seem to offer significant insight or dramatic improvement.  The techniques introduced are a small permutation of previous results.  The baselines are not particularly strong either. \n\nThe paper appeared to have be rushed. The presentation is not always clear. \n\nI also have the following questions I hope the authors could help me with:\n\n1. I failed to understand how Eqn (5). Could you please clarify. \n\n2. What is the significance of the math introduced in section 3? All that was proposed was: (1) Majority voting, (2) UCB exploration. \n\n3. Why comparing to A3C+ which is not necessarily better than A3C in final performance? \n\n4. Why not comparing to Bootstrapped DQN since the proposed method is based on it? \n\n5. Why is the proposed method better than Bootstrapped DQN, since UCB does not necessarily outperform Thompson sampling in the case of bandits? \n\n6. If there is a section on INFOGAIN exploration, why not mention it in the main text?[[CLA-POS],[JUS-POS],[DEP-POS],[FAI-POS],[CON-POS],[ENG-POS],[ACC-POS],[CST-POS],[NOV-NEG],[ETH-NEG]]
