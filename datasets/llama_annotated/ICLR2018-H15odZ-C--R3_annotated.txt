The authors propose the use of a gamma prior as the distribution over \nthe latent representation space in GANs.  The motivation behind it is that \nin GANs interpolating between sampled points is common in the process of generating examples but the use of a normal prior results in samples that fall in low probability mass regions. The use of the proposed gamma distribution, as a simple alternative, overcomes this problem.  \n\nIn general, the proposed work is very interesting and the idea is neat.  \nThe paper is well presented and I want to underline the importance of this. \nThe authors did a very good job presenting the problem, motivation and solution in a coherent fashion and easy to follow.  \n\nThe work itself is interesting and can provide useful alternatives for the distribution over the latent space[[CLA-POS],[JUS-POS],[DEP-POS],[FAI-POS],[CON-NON],[ENG-POS],[ACC-POS],[CST-NON],[NOV-POS],[ETH-NON]]
