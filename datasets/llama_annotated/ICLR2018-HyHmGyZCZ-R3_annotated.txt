I hate to say that the current version of this paper is not ready, as it is poorly written.  The authors present some observations of the weaknesses of the existing vector space models and list a 6-step approach for refining existing word vectors (GloVe in this work), and test the refined vectors on 80 TOEFL questions and 50 ESL questions.  In addition to the incoherent presentation, the proposed method lacks proper justification.  Given the small size of the datasets, it is also unclear how generalizable the approach is. \n\nPros:\n  1. Experimental study on retrofitting existing word vectors for ESL and TOEFL lexical similarity datasets \n\nCons:\u000b  1. The paper is poorly written and the proposed methods are not well justified. \n  2. Results on tiny datasets\n[[CLA-POS],[JUS-POS],[DEP-POS],[FAI-POS],[CON-NEG],[ENG-NEG],[ACC-POS],[CST-POS],[NOV-NEG],[ETH-NEG]]
