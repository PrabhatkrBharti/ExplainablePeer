Overall I like the paper and the results look nice in a diverse set of datasets and tasks such as edge-to-image, super-resolution, etc.  Unlike the generative distribution sampling of GANs, the method provides an interesting compositional scheme, where the low frequencies are regressed and the high frequencies are obtained by \"copying\" patches from the training set.  In some cases the results are similar to pix-to-pix (also in the numerical evaluation) but the method allows for one-to-many image generation, which is a important contribution.  Another positive aspect of the paper is that the synthesis results can be analyzed, providing insights for the generation process.  \n\nWhile most of the paper is well written,  some parts are difficult to parse.  For example, the introduction has some parts that look more like related work (that is mostly a personal preference in writting). Also in Section 3, the paragraph for distance functions do not provide any insight about what is used, but it is included in the next paragraph (I would suggest either merging or not highlighting the paragraphs). \n\nQ: The spatial grouping that is happening in the compositional stage, is it solely due to the multi-scale hypercolumns?   Would the result be more inconsistent if the hypercolumns had smaller receptive field? \n\nQ: For the multiple outputs, the k neighbor is selected at random?\n[[CLA-POS],[JUS-POS],[DEP-POS],[FAI-POS],[CON-POS],[ENG-POS],[ACC-POS],[CST-POS],[NOV-POS],[ETH-NEG]]
