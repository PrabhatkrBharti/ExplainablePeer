The authors present a deep neural network that evaluates plate numbers.  The relevance of this problem is that there are auctions for plate numbers in Hong Kong, and predicting their value is a sensible activity in that context.  I find that the description of the applied problem is quite interesting; in fact overall the paper is well written and very easy to follow.  There are some typos and grammatical problems (indicated below),  but nothing really serious. \n\nSo, the paper is relevant and well presented.  However, I find that the proposed solution is an application of existing techniques, so it lacks on novelty and originality.  Even though the significance of the work is apparent given the good results of the proposed neural network,  I believe that such material is more appropriate to a focused applied meeting.  However, even for that sort of setting I think the paper requires some additional work, as some final parts of the paper have not been tested yet (the interesting part of explanations).  Hence I don't think the submission is ready for publication at this moment. \n\nConcerning the text, some questions/suggestions:\n- Abstract, line 1: I suppose \"In the Chinese society...\"--- are there many Chinese societies? \n- The references are not properly formatted; they should appear at (XXX YYY) but appear as XXX (YYY) in many cases, mixed with the main text.  \n- Footnote 1, line 2: \"an exchange\". \n- Page 2, line 12: \"prices.  Among\".\n- Please add commas/periods at the end of equations. \n- There are problems with capitalization in the references.
