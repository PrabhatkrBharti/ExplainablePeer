The paper presents an application of a measure of dependence between the input power spectrum and the frequency response of a filter (Spectral Density Ratio from [Shajarisales et al 2015]) to cascades of two filters in successive layers of deep convolutional networks.  The authors apply their newly defined measure to DCGANs and plain VAEs with ReLUs, and show that dependency between successive layers may lead to bad performance.  \n\nThe paper proposed a possibly interesting approach,  but I found it quite hard to follow, especially Section 4, which I thought was quite unstructured.  Also Section 3 could be improved and simplified.  It would be also good to add some more related work.  I\u2019m not an expert, but I assume there must be some similar idea in CNNs.  \n\nFrom my limited point of view, this seems like a sound, novel and potentially useful application of a interesting idea.  If the writing was improved, I think the paper may have even more impact. \n\nSmaller details: some spacing issues, some extra punctuation (pg 5 \u201c. . Hence\u201d), a typo (pg. 7 \u201ctraining of the VAE did not lead to values as satisfactory AS what we obtained with the GAN\u201d)\n[[CLA-NEG],[JUS-POS],[DEP-NEG],[FAI-POS],[CON-POS],[ENG-NEG],[ACC-POS],[CST-POS],[NOV-POS],[ETH-NEG]]
