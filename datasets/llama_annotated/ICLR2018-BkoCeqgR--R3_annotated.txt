The authors test a CNN on images with color channels modified (such that the values of the three channels, after modification, are invariant to permutations). \n\nThe main positive point is that the performance does not degrade too much.  However, there are several important negative points which should prevent this work, as it is, from being published. \n\n1. Why is this type of color channel modification relevant for real life vision?  The invariance introduced here does not seem to be related to any real world phenomenon.  The nets, in principle, could learn to recognize objects based on shape only, and the shape remains stable when the color channels are changed. \n\n2. Why is the crash car dataset used in this scenario?  It is not clear to me why this types of theoretical invariance is tested on such as specific dataset.  Is there a real reason for that? \n\n3. The writing could be significantly improved, both at the grammatical level and the level of high level organization and presentation.  I think the authors should spend time on better motivating the choice of invariance used, as well as on testing with different (potentially new) architectures, color change cases, and datasets. \n\n4. There is no theoretical novelty and the empirical one seems to be very limited, with less convincing results.[[CLA-POS],[JUS-POS],[DEP-POS],[FAI-POS],[CON-POS],[ENG-POS],[ACC-POS],[CST-POS],[NOV-NEG],[ETH-NEG]]
