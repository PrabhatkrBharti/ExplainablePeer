The paper presents an approach for improving variational autoencoders for structured data that provide an output that is both syntactically valid and semantically reasonable.   The idea presented seems to have merit ,  however, I found the presentation lacking.  Many sentences are poorly written making the paper hard to read, especially when not familiar with the presented methods.  The experimental section could be organized better.  I didn't like that two types of experiment are now presented in parallel.  Finally, the paper stops abruptly without any final discussion and/or conclusion.
