The authors clearly describe the problem being addressed in the manuscript and motivate their solution very clearly.   The proposed solution seems very intuitive and the empirical evaluations demonstrates its utility.   My main concern is the underlying assumption (if I understand correctly) that the adversarial attack technique that the detector has to handle needs to be available at the training time of the detector.   Especially since the empirical evaluations are designed in such a way where the training and test data for the detector are perturbed with the same attack technique.  However, this does not invalidate the contributions of this manuscript. \n\nSpecific comments/questions:\n- (Minor) Page 3, Eq 1: I think the expansion dimension cares more about the probability mass in the volume rather than the volume itself even in the Euclidean setting. \n- Section 4: The different pieces of the problem (estimation, intuition for adversarial subspaces, efficiency) are very well described. \n- Alg 1, L3: Is this where the normal exmaples are converted to adversarial examples using some attack technique?  \n- Alg 1, L12: Is LID_norm computed using a leave-one-out estimate?  Otherwise, r_1(.) for each point is 0, leading to a somewhat \"under-estimate\" of the true LID of the normal points in the training set.  I understand that it is not an issue in the test set. \n- Section 4 and Alg 1: S we do not really care about the \"labels/targets\" of the examples.  All examples in the dataset are considered \"normal\" to start with.   Is this assuming that the \"initial training set\" which is used to obtain the \"pre-trained DNN\" free of adversarial examples?  \n- Section 5, Experimental Setup: Seems like normal points in the test set would get lesser values if we are not doing the \"leave-one-out\" version of the estimation.  \n- Section 5: The authors have done a great job at evaluating every aspect of the proposed method.\n[[CLA-NEG],[JUS-NEG],[DEP-NEG],[FAI-NEG],[CON-NEG],[ENG-NEG],[ACC-NEG],[CST-NEG],[NOV-NEG],[ETH-NEG]]
