This paper presents a new idea to use PACT to quantize networks, and showed improved compression and comparable accuracy to the original network.  The idea is interesting and novel that PACT has not been applied to compressing networks in the past.  The results from this paper is also promising that it showed convincing compression results.  \n\nThe experiments in this paper is also solid and has done extensive experiments on state of the art datasets and networks.  Results look promising too. \n\nOverall the paper is a descent one, but with limited novelty.
