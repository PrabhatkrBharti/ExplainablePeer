The main contribution of this paper are:\n(a) replacing the typical maximum likelihood criterion in neural language model training with a discriminative criterion, \n(b) propose two large margin criterion -- difference in likelihood and difference in rank (WER or BLUE ordered) hypotheses, \n(c) demonstrate performance gains two standard tasks -- an ASR task on Wall Street Journal (small task) and an MT task. \n\nIn addition, they provide examples in Figure (1) and (2) that illustrate the effect of the cost function on training.  Their illustration in Figure 4 is also helpful in seeing the impact of using a warm start with a generative model.\n[[CLA-POS],[JUS-POS],[DEP-POS],[FAI-POS],[CON-POS],[ENG-POS],[ACC-POS],[CST-POS],[NOV-POS],[ETH-NEG]]
