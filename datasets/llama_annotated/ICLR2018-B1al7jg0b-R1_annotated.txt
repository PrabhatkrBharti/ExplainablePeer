The paper leaves me guessing which part is a new contribution, and which one is already possible with conceptors as described in the Jaeger 2014 report.  Figure (1) in the paper is identical to the one in the (short version of) the Jaeger report but is missing an explicit reference.  Figure 2 is almost identical, again a reference to the original would be better. \nConceptors can be trained with a number of approaches (as described both in the 2014 Jaeger tech report and in the JMLR paper), including ridge regression.  What I am missing here is a clear indication what is an original contribution of the paper, and what is already possible using the original approach.  The fact that additional conceptors can be trained does not appear new for the approach described here.  If the presented approach was an improvement over the original conceptors, the evaluation should compare the new and the original version. \n\nThe evaluation also leaves me a little confused in an additional dimension: the paper title and abstract suggested that the contribution is about overcoming catastrophic forgetting.  The evaluation shows that the approach performs better classifying MNIST digits than another approach.  This is nice but doesn't really tell me much about overcoming catastrophic forgetting. \n[[CLA-NEG],[JUS-POS],[DEP-POS],[FAI-POS],[CON-POS],[ENG-POS],[ACC-POS],[CST-POS],[NOV-POS],[ETH-POS]]
