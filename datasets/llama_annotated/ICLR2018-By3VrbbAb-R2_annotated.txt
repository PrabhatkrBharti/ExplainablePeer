This paper focuses on solving query completion problem with error correction which is a very practical and important problem.  The idea is character based.  And in order to achieve three important targets which are auto completion, auto error correction and real time, the authors first adopt the character-level RNN-based modeling which can be easily combined with error correction, and then carefully optimize the inference part to make it real time. \n\nPros:\n(1) the paper is very well organized and easy to read .\n(2) the proposed method is nicely designed to solve the specific real problem. For example, the edit distance is modified to be more consistent with the task. \n(3) detailed information are provided about the experiments, such as data, model and inference. \n\nCons:\n(1) No direct comparisons with other methods are provided.  I am not familiar with the state-of-the-art methods in this field.  If the performance (hit rate or coverage) of this paper is near stoa methods, then such experimental results will make this paper much more soli[[CLA-NEG],[JUS-POS],[DEP-POS],[FAI-POS],[CON-POS],[ENG-POS],[ACC-POS],[CST-POS],[NOV-POS],[ETH-NEG]]
