The paper discusses a method for adjusting image embeddings in order tease apart technical variation from biological signal.  A loss function based on the Wasserstein distance is used. \nThe paper is interesting  but could certainly do with more explanations.  \n\nComments:\n1. It is difficult for the reader to understand a) why Wasserstein is used " and b) how exactly the nuisance variation is reduced." \nA dedicated section on motivation is missing.` \n\n2. Does the Deep Metric network always return a '64-dim' vector?  \nHave you checked your model using different length vectors?  \n\n3. Label the y-axis in Fig 2. \n\n4. The fact that you have early-stopping as opposed to a principled regularizer also requires further substantiation.[[CLA-POS],[JUS-POS],[DEP-POS],[FAI-POS],[CON-POS],[ENG-POS],[ACC-POS],[CST-POS],[NOV-NEU],[ETH-NEU]]
