The paper presents a new approach to generate adversarial attacks to a neural network, and subsequently present a method to defend a neural network from those attacks.  I am not familiar with other adversarial attack strategies aside from the ones mentioned in this paper, and therefore I cannot properly assess how innovative the method is. \n\nMy comments are the following:\n\n1- I would like to know if benign examples are just regular examples or some short of simple way of computing adversarial attacks. \n\n2- I think the authors should provide a more detailed and formal description of the OPTMARGIN method.  In section 3.2 they explain that \"Our attack uses existing optimization attack techniques to...\", but one should be able to understand the method without reading further references.  Specially a formal representation of the method should be included. \n\n3- Authors mention that OPTSTRONG attack does not succeed in finding adversarial examples (\"it succeeds on 28% of the samples on MNIST;73% on CIFAR-10\").  What is the meaning of success rate in here?  Is it the % of times that the classifier is confused? \n\n4- OPTSTRONG produces images that are notably more distorted than OPTBRITTLE (by RMS and also visually in the case of MNIST).  So I actually cannot tell which method is better, at least in the MNIST experiment.  One could do a method that completely distort the image and therefore will be classified with as a class.  But adversarial images should be visually undistinguishable from original images.  Generated CIFAR images seem similar than the originals, although CIFAR images are very low resolution, so judging this is hard. \n\n4- As a side note, it would be interesting to have an explanation about why region classification is providing a worse accuracy than point classification for CIFAR-10 benign samples. \n\nAs a summary, the authors presented a method that successfully attacks other existing defense methods, and present a method that can successfully defend this attack.  I would like to see more formal definitions of the methods presented.  Also, just by looking at RMS it is expected that this method works better than OPTBRITTLE, since the images are more distorted.  It would be needed to have a way of visually evaluate the similarity between original images and generated images[[CLA-NEG],[JUS-NEG],[DEP-POS],[FAI-POS],[CON-POS],[ENG-NEG],[ACC-POS],[CST-POS],[NOV-POS],[ETH-POS]]
