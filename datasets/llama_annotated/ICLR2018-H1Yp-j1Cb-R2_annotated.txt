This is an interesting paper, exploring GAN dynamics using ideas from online learning, in particular the pioneering \"sparring\" follow-the-regularized leader analysis of Freund and Schapire (using what is listed here as Lemma 4).  By restricting the discriminator to be a single layer, the maximum player plays over a concave (parameter) space which stabilizes the full sequence of losses so that Lemma 3 can be proved, allowing proof of the dynamics' convergence to a Nash equilibrium.  The analysis suggests a practical (heuristic) algorithm incorporating two features which emerge from the theory: L2 regularization and keeping a history of past models.  A very simple queue for the latter is shown to do quite competitively in practice. \n\nThis paper merits acceptance on theoretical merits alone, because the FTRL analysis for convex-concave games is a very robust tool from theory (see also the more recent sequel [Syrgkanis et al. 2016 \"Fast convergence of regularized learning in games\"]) that is natural to employ to gain insight on the much more brittle GAN case.  The practical aspects are also interesting, because the incorporation of added randomness into the mixed generation strategy is an area where theoretical justifications do motivate practical performance gains; these ideas could clearly be developed in future work[[CLA-POS],[JUS-POS],[DEP-POS],[FAI-POS],[CON-POS],[ENG-POS],[ACC-POS],[CST-NEG],[NOV-POS],[ETH-NEG]]
