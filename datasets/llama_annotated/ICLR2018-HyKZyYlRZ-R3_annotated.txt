The paper presents a multi-task architecture that can perform multiple tasks across multiple different domains.  The authors design an architecture that works on image captioning, image classification, machine translation and parsing.\ n\nThe proposed model can maintain performance of single-task models and in some cases show slight improvements.  This is the main take-away from this paper.  \n\nThere is a factually incorrect statement - depthwise separable convolutions were not introduced in Chollet 2016.  Section 2 of the same paper also notes it (depthwise convolutions can be traced back to at least 2012).[[CLA-POS],[JUS-POS],[DEP-POS],[FAI-POS],[CON-NEG],[ENG-POS],[ACC-POS],[CST-NEG],[NOV-NEG],[ETH-POS]]
