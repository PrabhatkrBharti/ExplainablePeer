This paper views graph classification as image classification, and shows that the CNN model adapted from image net can be effectively adapted to the graph classification.  The idea is interesting and the result looks promising,  but I do not understand the intuition behind the success of analogizing graph with images. \n\nFundamentally, a convolutional filter stands for a operation within a small neighborhood on the image.  However, it is unclear how it means for the graph representation.  Is the neighborhood predefined?  Are the graph nodes pre-ordered?  \n\nI am also curious with the effect of pre-trained model from ImageNet.  Since the graph presentation does not use color channels,  pre-trained model is used different from what it was designed to.  I would imagine the benefit of using ImageNet is just to bring a random, high-dimensional embedding.   In addition, I wonder whether it will help to fine-tune the model on the graph classification data.  Could this submission show some fine-tune experiments?[[CLA-POS],[JUS-POS],[DEP-POS],[FAI-POS],[CON-POS],[ENG-POS],[ACC-POS],[CST-NEG],[NOV-NEG],[ETH-NEG]]
