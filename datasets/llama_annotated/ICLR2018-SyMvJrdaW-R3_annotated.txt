The main contribution of this paper is a particular Taylor expansion of the outputs of a ResNet which is shown to be exact at almost all points in the input space.   This expression is used to develop a new layer called a \u201cwarp layer\u201d which essentially tries to compute several layers of the residual network using the Taylor expansion expression \u2014 however in this expression, things can be done in parallel, and interestingly, the authors show that the gradients also decouple when the (ResNet) model is close to a local minimum in a certain sense, which may motivate the decoupling of layers to begin with.   Finally the authors stack these warp layers to create a \u201cwarped resnet\u201d which they show does about as well as an ordinary ResNet but has better parallelization properties. \n\nTo me the analytical parts of the paper are the most interesting, particularly in showing how the gradients approximately decouple.   However there are several weaknesses to the paper (or maybe just things I didn\u2019t understand).   First,  a major part of the paper tries to make the case that there is a symmetry breaking property of the proposed model, which I am afraid I simply was not able to follow.   Some of the notation is confusing here \u2014 for example, presumably the rotations refer to image level rotations rather than literally multiplying the inputs by an orthogonal matrix, which the notation suggests to be the case.   It is also never precisely spelled out what the final theoretical guarantee is (preferably the authors would do this in the form of a proposition or theorem). \n\nThroughout, the authors write out equations as if the weights in all layers are equal, but this is confusing even if the authors say that this is what they are doing, since their explanation is not very clear.   The confusion is particularly acute in places where derivatives are taken, because the derivatives continue to be taken as if the weights were untied, but then written as if they happened to be the same. \n\nFinally the experimental results are okay  but perhaps a bit preliminary.   I have a few recommendations here:\n* It would be stronger to evaluate results on a larger dataset like ILSVRC.   \n* The relative speed-up of WarpNet compared to ResNet needs to be better explained \u2014 the authors break the computation of the WarpNet onto two GPUs, but it\u2019s not clear if they do this for the (vanilla) ResNet as well.   In batch mode, the easiest way to parallelize is to have each GPU evaluate half the batch.   Even in a streaming mode where images need to be evaluated one by one, there are ways to pipeline execution of the residual blocks, and I do not see any discussion of these alternatives in the paper. \n* In the experimental results, K is set to be 2, and the authors only mention in passing that they have tried larger K in the conclusion.   It would be good to have a more thorough experimental evaluation of the trade-offs of setting K to be higher values. \n\nA few remaining questions for the authors:\n* There is a parallel submission (presumably by different authors called \u201cResidual Connections Encourage Iterative Inference\u201d) which contains some related insights.   I wonder what are the differences between the two Taylor expansions, and whether the insights of this paper could be used to help the other paper and vice versa? \n* On implementation - the authors mention using Tensorflow\u2019s auto-differentiation.   My question here is \u2014 are gradients being re-used intelligently as suggested in Section 3.1?   \n* I notice that the analysis about the vanishing Hessian could be applied to most of the popular neural network architectures available now.   How much of the ideas offered in this paper would then generalize to non-resnet settings?\n\n[[CLA-POS],[JUS-POS],[DEP-POS],[FAI-POS],[CON-POS],[ENG-POS],[ACC-POS],[CST-POS],[NOV-POS],[ETH-NEG]]
