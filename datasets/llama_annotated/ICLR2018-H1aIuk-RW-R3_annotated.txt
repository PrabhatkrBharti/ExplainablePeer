This paper studies active learning for convolutional neural networks . Authors formulate the active learning problem as core-set selection and present a novel strategy. \n\nExperiments are performed on three datasets to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method comparing with some baselines. \n\nTheoretical analysis is presented to show the performance of any selected subset using the geometry of the data points. \n\nAuthors are suggested to perform experiments on more datasets to make the results more convincing. \n\nThe initialization of the CNN model is not clearly introduced, which however, may affect the performance significantly[[CLA-POS],[JUS-POS],[DEP-POS],[FAI-POS],[CON-POS],[ENG-NEG],[ACC-POS],[CST-POS],[NOV-NEG],[ETH-NEG]]
