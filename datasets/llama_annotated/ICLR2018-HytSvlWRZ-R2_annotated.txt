The authors propose a DNN, called subspace network, for nonlinear multi-task censored regression problem.  The topic is important. Experiments on real data show improvements compared to several traditional approaches. \n\nMy major concerns are as follows. \n\n1. The paper is not self-contained.  The authors claim that they establish both asymptotic and non-asymptotic convergence properties for Algorithm 1.  However, for some key steps in the proof, they refer to other references.  If this is due to space limitation in the main text, they may want to provide a complete proof in the appendix. \n\n2. The experiments are unconvincing.  They compare the proposed SN with other traditional approaches on a very small data  set with 670 samples and 138 features.  A major merit of DNN is that it can automatically extract useful features.  However, in this experiment, the features are handcrafted before they are fed into the models.  Thus, I would like to see a comparison between SN with vanilla DNN. [[CLA-POS],[JUS-POS],[DEP-POS],[FAI-POS],[CON-POS],[ENG-POS],[ACC-POS],[CST-POS],[NOV-POS],[ETH-NEG]]
