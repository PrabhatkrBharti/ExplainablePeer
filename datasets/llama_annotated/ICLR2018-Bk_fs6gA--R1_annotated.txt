Learning to solve combinatorial optimization problems using recurrent networks is a very interesting research topic.  However, I had a very hard time understanding the paper.  It certainly doesn\u2019t help that I\u2019m not familiar with the architectures the model is based on, nor with state-of-the-art integer programming solvers. \n\nThe architecture was described but not really motivated.  The authors chose to study only random instances which are known to be bad representatives of real-world problmes, instead of picking a standard benchmark problem.  Furthermore, the insights on how the network is actually solving the problems and how the proposed components contribute to the solution are minimal, if any.\n\n The experimental issues (especially regarding the baseline) raised by the anonymous comments below were rather troubling; it\u2019s a pity they were left unanswered.\n\n Hopefully other expert reviewers will be able to provide constructive feedback.[[CLA-POS],[JUS-POS],[DEP-POS],[FAI-POS],[CON-POS],[ENG-POS],[ACC-POS],[CST-POS],[NOV-NEU],[ETH-NEU]]
