This paper applies several NN architectures to classify url\u2019s between benign and malware related URLs. \nThe baseline is random forests and feature engineering. \n\nThis is clearly an application paper.  \nNo new method is being proposed, only existing methods are applied directly to the task. \n\nI am not familiar with the task at hand so I cannot properly judge the quality/accuracy of the results obtained but it seems ok. \nFor evaluation data was split randomly in 80% train, 10% test and 10% validation.  Given the amount of data 2*10**6 samples, this seems sufficient. \nI think the evaluation could be improved by using malware URLs that were obtained during a larger time window. \nSpecifically, it would be nice if train, test and validation URLs would be operated chronologically. I.e. all train url precede the validation and test urls. \nIdeally, the train and test urls would also be different in time.  This would enable a better test of the generalization capabilities in what is essentially a continuously changing environment.  \n\nThis paper is a very difficult for me to assign a final rating. \nThere is no obvious technical mistake  and the paper is written reasonably well. \nThere is however a lack of technical novelty or insight in the models themselves.  \nI think that the paper should be submitted to a journal or conference in the application domain where it would be a better fit. \n\nFor this reason, I will give the score marginally below the acceptance threshold now. \nBut if the other reviewers argue that the paper should be accepted I will change my score.\n\n[[CLA-POS],[JUS-POS],[DEP-POS],[FAI-POS],[CON-POS],[ENG-POS],[ACC-POS],[CST-NEG],[NOV-NEG],[ETH-NEG]]
