- algorithm 1 has a lot of problem specific hyperparametes that may be difficult to get right . Not clear how important they are\n- they analyze the simpler (analytically and likely computationally) Boolean hyperparameter case (each hyperparameter is binary).  Not a realistic setting.  In their experiments they use these binary parameter spaces so I'm not sure how much I buy that it is straightforward to use continuous valued polynomials.  \n- interesting idea but I think it's more theoretical than practical.  Feels like a hammer in need of a nail[[CLA-NEG],[JUS-POS],[DEP-POS],[FAI-POS],[CON-NEG],[ENG-POS],[ACC-POS],[CST-NEG],[NOV-NEG],[ETH-NEG]]
