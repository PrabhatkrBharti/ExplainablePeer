This paper presents an simple and interesting idea to improve the performance for neural nets.  The idea is we can reduce the precision for activations and increase the number of filters, and is able to achieve better memory usage (reduced).  The paper is aiming to solve a practical problem, and has done some solid research work to validate that.   In particular, this paper has also presented a indepth study on AlexNet with very comprehensive results and has validated the usefulness of this approach.    \n\nIn addition, in their experiments, they have demonstrated pretty solid experimental results, on AlexNet and even deeper nets such as the state of the art Resnet.  The results are convincing to me.  \n\nOn the other side, the idea of this paper does not seem extremely interesting to me, especially many decisions are quite natural to me, and it looks more like a very empirical practical study.  So the novelty is limited. \n\nSo overall given limited novelty  but the paper presents useful results,  I would recommend borderline leaning towards reject.[[CLA-NEG],[JUS-POS],[DEP-POS],[FAI-POS],[CON-POS],[ENG-POS],[ACC-POS],[CST-POS],[NOV-MIX],[ETH-POS]]
