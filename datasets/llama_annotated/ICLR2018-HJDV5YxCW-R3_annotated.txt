This paper presents an extension of binary networks, and the main idea is to use different bit rates for different layers so we can further reduce bitrate of the overall net, and achieve better performance (speed / memory).  The paper addresses a real problem which is meaningful, and provides interesting insights, but it is more of an extension. \n\nThe description of the Heterogeneous Bitwidth Binarization algorithm is interesting and simple, and potentially can be practical, However it also adds more complication to real world implementations, and might not be an elegant enough approach for practical usages.  \n\nExperiments wise, the paper has done solid experiments comparing with existing approaches and showed the gain.  Results are promising. \n\nOverall, I am leaning towards a rejection mostly due to limited novelty[[CLA-POS],[JUS-POS],[DEP-POS],[FAI-POS],[CON-NEG],[ENG-POS],[ACC-POS],[CST-POS],[NOV-NEG],[ETH-NEG]]
