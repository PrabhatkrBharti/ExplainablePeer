In this paper, the authors present an adaptation of space-by-time non-negative matrix factorization (SbT-NMF) that can rigorously account for the pre-stimulus baseline activity.  The authors go on to compare their baseline-corrected (BC) method with several established methods for dimensionality reduction of spike train data.\n\n Overall, the results are a bit mixed.  The BC method often performs similarly to or is outperformed by non-BC SbT-NMF.  The authors provide a possible mechanism to explain these results, by analyzing classification performance as a function of baseline firing rate.  The authors posit that their method can be useful when sensory responses are on the order of magnitude of baseline activity; however, this doesn't fully address why non-BC SbT-NMF can strongly outperform the BC method in certain tasks (e.g. the step of light, Fig. 3b).  Finally, while this method introduces a principled way to remove mean baseline activity from the sensory-driven response, this may also discount the effect that baseline firing rate and fast temporal fluctuations can have on the response (Destexhe et al., Nature Reviews Neuroscience 4, 2003; Gutnisky DA et al., Cerebral Cortex 27, 2017).[[CLA-NEG],[JUS-NEG],[DEP-POS],[FAI-POS],[CON-POS],[ENG-POS],[ACC-POS],[CST-POS],[NOV-POS],[ETH-POS]]
