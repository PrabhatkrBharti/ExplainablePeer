The idea is clearly stated (but lacks some details) and I enjoyed reading the paper.  \n\nI understand the difference between [Kos+17] and the proposed scheme but I could not understand in which situation the proposed scheme works better.  From the adversary's standpoint, it would be easier to manipulate inputs than latent variables.  On the other hand, I agree that sample-independent perturbation is much more practical than sample-dependent perturbation. \n\nIn Section 3.1, the attack methods #2 and #3 should be detailed more.  I could not imagine how VAE and T are trained simultaneously. \n\nIn Section 3.2, the authors listed a couple of loss functions.  How were these loss functions are combined?  The final optimization problem that is used for training of the propose VAE should be formally defined.  Also, the detailed specification of the VAE should be detailed. \n\nFrom figures in Figure 4 and Figure 5, I could see that the proposed scheme performs successfully in a qualitative manner,  however, it is difficult to evaluate the proposed scheme qualitatively without comparisons with baselines.  For example, can the proposed scheme can be compared with [Kos+17] or some other sample-dependent attacks?  Also, can you experimentally show that attacks on latent variables are more powerful than attacks on inputs?\n\n\n[[CLA-POS],[JUS-POS],[DEP-POS],[FAI-POS],[CON-POS],[ENG-POS],[ACC-POS],[CST-POS],[NOV-POS],[ETH-NEG]]
