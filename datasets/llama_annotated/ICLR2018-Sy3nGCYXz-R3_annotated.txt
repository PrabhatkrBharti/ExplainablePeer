This paper try to analyze the intrinsic structure of VGG19 and give a new insight of deep neural networks.  The authors propose to use SVD tools to estimate the dimension of the deep manifolds, and conduct experiments on three categories of ImageNet.  The papers are written well and easy to follow.  The analysis of manifold structure of DNN is important direction, but I am afraid novelty and insight of this work is not enough for acceptance. \npros:\n 1. The paper is well written and easy to follow. \n 2. Manifold analysis of the intrinsic structure of DNN is a important direction for further study. \ncons:\n 1. SVD is a standard tool for subspace and manifold analysis for decades of years.  I do not think using it in DNN is a big contribution. \n2. The authors should explain why choosing VGG19 for analysis.  Do other deep neural networks, such as Resnet, Googlenet, can  have the same phenomenon? \n3. Why the authors choose Persian Cat, Container Ship, and Volcano in the experiments?  Do other categories have the similar results? \n4. The authors can indicate the application scenario of this work.  For example, this work may guide to design better CNN structure for higher accuracy and lower computation cost.  It may help the readers better understand the values of this work.\n    [[CLA-POS],[JUS-POS],[DEP-POS],[FAI-POS],[CON-POS],[ENG-POS],[ACC-POS],[CST-POS],[NOV-NEG],[ETH-NEG]]
