This paper presents a useful dataset for testing reading comprehension while avoiding significant lexical overlap between question and document.  The paper rightly mentions that existing reading comprehension datasets (e.g. SQuAD) where the current methods are already performing at the human level largely due to large lexical overlap between question and document.  The authors have devised a clever way to create a reading comprehension dataset without a lot of lexical overlap by using parallel plots of movies from Wikipedia and IMDB.  \n\nThis paper contributes a useful new dataset that fixes some of the shortcomings of existing reading comprehension datasets where the task is made easier by lexical overlap.  The authors also present an analysis of the data by applying one of the SOTA techniques on SQuAD to this data.  They also analyze the effect of various span-identification steps and preprocessing steps on the performance.  Overall, this paper contributes a useful new dataset that can be quite useful for reading comprehension[[CLA-POS],[JUS-POS],[DEP-POS],[FAI-POS],[CON-POS],[ENG-POS],[ACC-POS],[CST-POS],[NOV-POS],[ETH-NEG]]
