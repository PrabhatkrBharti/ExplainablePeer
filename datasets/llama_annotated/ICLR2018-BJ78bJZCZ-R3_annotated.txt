Summary:\nThis paper proposes an extension to the RWA model by introducing the discount gates to computed discounted averages instead of the undiscounted attention.  The problem with the RWA is that the averaging mechanism can be numerically unstable due to the accumulation operations when computing d_t. \n\nPros:\n- Addresses an issue of RWAs. \n\nCons:\n-The paper addresses a problem with an issue with RWAs.  But it is not clear to me why would that be an important contribution. \n-The writing needs more work. \n-The experiments are lacking and the results are not good enough. \n\nGeneral Comments:\n\nThis paper addresses an issue regarding to RWA which is not really widely adopted and well-known architecture, because it seems to have some have some issues that this paper is trying to address.  I would still like to have a better justification on why should we care about RWA and fixing that model.  \n\nThe writing of this paper seriously needs more work.   The Lemma 1 doesn't make sense to me, I think it has a typo in it, it should have been (-1)^t c instead of -1^t c. \n\nThe experiments are only on toyish and small scale tasks.  According to the results the model doesn't really do better than a simple LSTM or GRU.[[CLA-POS],[JUS-POS],[DEP-POS],[FAI-MIX],[CON-POS],[ENG-MIX],[ACC-POS],[CST-POS],[NOV-NEG],[ETH-NEG]]
