This paper proposes a new space for reasoning about human identity.  It proposes a new dataset based on an artist's work, and compares existing methods in terms of the realism of the synthetic faces they can create.  \n\nPros:\n+ The results are very pleasing visually. \n+ The authors show that one of the existing methods can fairly successfully fool humans to believe its synthetic results are actual human faces. \n\nCons:\n- There is no new methodology proposed. \n- If the main contribution is the dataset, perhaps the claim that it is \"uniquely diverse\" could be justified with some quantitative arguments / statistics, comparing to other datasets.  \n- Since there are existing methods to generate images from a textual description (e.g. Zhang ICCV 2017, \"StackGAN\"), Fig. 10 merits a comparison to those. \n- It would have been convincing to see an experiment showing actual use of the proposed method for navigating the face space, e.g. for finding criminals based on a description. \n\nQuestions:\n- \"Inventing plausible fine details while preserving identity\" -- since identity is created and there is no ground truth, where does the line between \"fine detail\" and \"new identity\" lie? \n- Some notation is not defined in the equation on the last page.[[CLA-POS],[JUS-POS],[DEP-POS],[FAI-POS],[CON-POS],[ENG-POS],[ACC-POS],[CST-POS],[NOV-NEG],[ETH-NEG]]
