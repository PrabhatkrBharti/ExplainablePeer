The submitted manuscript describes an exercise in performance comparison for neural language models under standardization of the hyperparameter tuning and model selection strategies and costs.  This type of study is important to give perspective to non-standardized performance scores reported across separate publications,  and indeed the results here are interesting as they favour relatively simpler structures. \n\nI have a favourable impression of this paper  but would hope another reviewer is more familiar with the specific application domain than I am.[[CLA-POS],[JUS-POS],[DEP-NEG],[FAI-POS],[CON-NEG],[ENG-NEG],[ACC-POS],[CST-POS],[NOV-NEG],[ETH-NEG]]
