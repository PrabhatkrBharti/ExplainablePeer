The paper proposed a generalized HMC by modifying the leapfrog integrator using neural networks to make the sampler to converge and mix quickly.  Mixing is one of the most challenge problems for a MCMC sampler, particularly when there are many modes in a distribution.  The derivations look correct to me.  In the experiments, the proposed algorithm was compared to other methods, e.g., A-NICE-MC and HMC.  It showed that the proposed method could mix between the modes in the posterior.  Although the method could mix well when applied to those particular experiments,  it lacks theoretical justifications why the method could mix well.[[CLA-POS],[JUS-POS],[DEP-POS],[FAI-POS],[CON-POS],[ENG-POS],[ACC-POS],[CST-POS],[NOV-POS],[ETH-NEG]]
