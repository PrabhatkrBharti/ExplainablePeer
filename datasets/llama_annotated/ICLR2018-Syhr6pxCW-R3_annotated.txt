This paper proposes a compositional nearest-neighbors approach to image synthesis, including results on several conditional image generation datasets.  \n\nPros:\n- Simple approach based on nearest-neighbors, likely easier to train compared to GANs. \n- Scales to high-resolution images. \n\nCons:\n- Requires a potentially costly search procedure to generate images. \n- Seems to require relevant objects and textures to be present in the training set in order to succeed at any given conditional image generation task.[[CLA-POS],[JUS-POS],[DEP-POS],[FAI-POS],[CON-NEG],[ENG-POS],[ACC-POS],[CST-NEG],[NOV-NEG],[ETH-NEG]]
