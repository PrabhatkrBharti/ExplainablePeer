This paper tried to analyze the subspaces of the adversarial examples neighborhood.  More specifically, the authors used Local Intrinsic Dimensionality to analyze the intrinsic dimensional property of the subspaces.   The characteristics and theoretical analysis of the proposed method are discussed and explained.   This paper helps others to better understand the vulnerabilities of DNNs.[[CLA-POS],[JUS-POS],[DEP-POS],[FAI-POS],[CON-POS],[ENG-POS],[ACC-POS],[CST-POS],[NOV-POS],[ETH-NEG]]
