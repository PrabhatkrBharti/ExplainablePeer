Summary: \nThe paper considers the problem of a single hidden layer neural network, with 2 RELU units (this is what I got from the paper - as I describe below, it was not clear at all the setting of the problem  - if I'm mistaken, I will also wait for the rest of the reviews to have a more complete picture of the problem). \nGiven this architecture, the authors focus on characterizing the objective landscape of such a problem. \nThe techniques used depend on previous work.  According to the authors, this paper extends(?) previous results on a NN with a single layer with a single unit. \n\nOriginality: \nThe paper heavily depends on the approach followed by Brutzkus and Globerson, 2017.  To this end, slighly novel. \n\nImportance: \nUnderstanding the landscape (local vs global minima vs saddle points) is an important direction in order to further understand when and why deep neural networks work.  I would say that the topic is an important one. \n\nPresentation/Clarity: \nTo the best of my understanding, the paper has some misconceptions.  The title is not clear whether the paper considers a two layer RELU network or a single layer with with two RELU units.  In the abstract the authors state that it has to do with a two-layer RELU network with two hidden units (per layer? in total?).  Later on, in Section 3, the expression at the bottom of page 2 seems to consider a single-layer RELU network, with two units.  \nThese are crucial for understanding the contribution of the paper; while reading the paper, I assumed that the authors consider the case of a single hidden unit with K = 2 RELU activations (however, that complicated my understanding on how it compares with state of the art). \n\nAnother issue is the fact that, on my humble opinion, the main text looks like a long proof.  It would be great to have more intuitions. \n\nComments:\n1. The paper mainly focuses on a specific problem instance, where the weight vectors are unit-normed and orthogonal to each other.  While the authors already identify that this might be a restriction, it still does not lessen the fact that the configuration considered is a really specific one. \n\n2. The paper reads like a collection of lemmas, with no verbose connection.  It was hard to read and understand their value, just because mostly the text was structured as one lemma after the other. \n\n3. It is not clear from the text whether the setting is already considered in Brutzkus and Globerson, 2017.  Please clarify how your work is different/new from previous works.\n[[CLA-NEG],[JUS-POS],[DEP-POS],[FAI-POS],[CON-POS],[ENG-POS],[ACC-POS],[CST-POS],[NOV-POS],[ETH-NEG]]
