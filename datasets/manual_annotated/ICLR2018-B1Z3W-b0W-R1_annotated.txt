This paper proposes an iterative inference scheme for latent variable models that use inference networks.  Instead of using a fixed-form inference network, the paper proposes to use the learning to learn approach of Andrychowicz et. al.  The parameter of the inference network is still a fixed quantity but the function mapping is based on a deep network (e.g. it could be RNN but the experiments uses a feed-forward network). \n\nMy main issue with the paper is that it does not do a good job justifying the main advantages of the proposed approach.  It appears that the iterative method should result in \"direct improvement with additional samples and inference iterations\".  I am supposing this is at the test time.  It is not clear exactly when this will be useful.  \n\nI believe an iterative approach is also possible to perform with the standard VAE, e.g., by bootstrapping over the input data and then using the iterative scheme of Rezende et. al.  2014 (they used this method to perform data imputation). \n\nThe paper should also discuss the additional difficulty that arises when training the proposed model and compare them to training of standard inference networks in VAE. \n\nIn summary, the paper needs to do a better job in justifying the advantages obtained by the proposed method.
