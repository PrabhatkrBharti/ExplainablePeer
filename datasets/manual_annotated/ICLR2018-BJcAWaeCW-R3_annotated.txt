The proposed approach, GTI, has many free parameters: number of layers L, number of communities in each layer, number of non-overlapping subgraphs M, number of nodes in each subgraph k, etc.   No analysis is reported on how these affect the performance of GTI. \n\nGTI uses the Louvain hierarchical community detection method to identify the hierarchy in the graph and METIS to partition the communities.   How important are these two methods to the success of GTI? \n\nWhy is it reasonable to restore a k-by-k adjacency matrix from the standard uniform distribution (as stated in Section 2.1)? \n\nWhy is the stride for the convolutional/deconvoluational layers set to 2 (as stated in Section 2.1)? \n\nEquation 1 has a symbol E in it.   E is defined (in Section 2.2) to be \"all the inter-subgraph (community) edges identified by the Louvain method for each hierarchy. \"  However, E can be intra-community because communities are partitioned by METIS.   More discussion is needed about the role of edges in E.  \n\nEquation 3 sparsifies (i.e. prunes the edges) of a graph -- namely $re_{G}$.   However, it is not clear how one selects a $re^{i}{G}$ from among the various i values.   The symbol i is an index into $CV_{i}$, the cut-value of the i-th largest unique weight-value. \n\nWas the edge-importance reported in Section 2.3 checked against various measures of edge importance such as edge betweenness? \n\nTable 1 needs more discussion in terms of retained edge percentage for ordered stages.   Should one expect a certain trend in these sequences? \n\nAlmost all of the experiments are qualitative and can be easily made quantitive by comparing PageRank or degree of nodes. \n\nThe discussion on graph sampling does not include how much of the graph was sampled.   Thus, the comparisons in Tables 2 and 3 are not fair.\n\nThe most realistic graph generator is the BTER model.
