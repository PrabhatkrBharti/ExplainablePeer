The authors suggest using a variational autoencoder to infer binary relationships between medical entities.  The model is quite simple and intuitive and the authors demonstrate that it can generate meaningful relationships between pairs of entities that were not observed before.   \nWhile the paper is very well-written  I have certain concerns regarding the motivation, model, and evaluation methodology followed: \n\n1) A stronger motivation for this model is required.  Having a generative model for causal relationships between symptoms and diseases is \"intriguing\" yet I am really struggling with the motivation of getting such a model from word co-occurences in a medical corpus.  I can totally buy the use of the proposed model as means to generate additional training data for a discriminative model used for information extraction but the authors need to do a better job at explaining the downstream applications of their model.  \n\n2) The word embeddings used seem to be sufficient to capture the \"knowledge\" included in the corpus.  An ablation study of the impact of word embeddings on this model is required.  \n\n3) The authors do not describe how the data from xywy.com were annotated.  Were they annotated by experts in the medical domain or random users? \n\n4) The metric of quality is particularly ad-hoc[[CLA-POS],[JUS-POS],[DEP-POS],[FAI-NEU],[CON-POS],[ENG-POS],[ACC-POS],[CST-POS],[NOV-NEU],[ETH-NEU]]
