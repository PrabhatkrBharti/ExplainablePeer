This paper proposes to use 3D conditional GAN models to generate\nfMRI scans.  Using the generated images, paper reports improvement\nin classification accuracy on various tasks. \n\nOne claim of the paper is that a generative model of fMRI\ndata can help to caracterize and understand variability of scans\nacross subjects. \n\nArticle is based on recent works such as Wasserstein GANs and AC-GANs\nby (Odena et al., 2016). \n\nDespite the rich literature of this recent topic the related work\nsection is rather convincing. \n\nModel presented extends IW-GAN by using 3D convolution and also\nby supervising the generator using sample labels. 1\n\nMajor:\n\n- The size of the generated images is up to 26x31x22 which is limited\n(about half the size of the actual resolution of fMRI data).  As a\nconsequence results on decoding learning task using low resolution\nimages can end up worse than with the actual data (as pointed out). \nWhat it means is that the actual impact of the work is probably limited. \n\n- Generating high resolution images with GANs even on faces for which\nthere is almost infinite data is still a challenge.  Here a few thousand\ndata points are used.  So it raises too concerns: First is it enough? \nUsing so-called learning curves is a good way to answer this.  Second\nis what are the contributions to the state-of-the-art of the 2\nmethods introduced?  Said differently, as there\nis no classification results using images produced by an another\nGAN architecture it is hard to say that the extra complexity\nproposed here (which is a bit contribution of the work) is actually\nnecessary. \n\nMinor:\n\n- Fonts in figure 4 are too small.\n[[CLA-POS],[JUS-POS],[DEP-POS],[FAI-NEU],[CON-POS],[ENG-POS],[ACC-POS],[CST-POS],[NOV-NEU],[ETH-NEU]]
