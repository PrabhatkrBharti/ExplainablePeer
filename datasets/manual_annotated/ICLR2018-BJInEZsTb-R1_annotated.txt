This paper introduces a generative approach for 3D point clouds.  More specifically, two Generative Adversarial approaches are introduced: Raw point cloud GAN, and Latent-space GAN (r-GAN and l-GAN as referred to in the paper).  In addition, a GMM sampling + GAN decoder approach to generation is also among the experimented variations.  \n\nThe results look convincing for the generation experiments in the paper, both from class-specific (Figure 1) and multi-class generators (Figure 6).  \n\nOne question that arises is whether the point cloud approaches to generation is any more valuable compared to voxel-grid based approaches.  Especially Octree based approaches [1-below] show very convincing and high-resolution shape generation results,  whereas the details seem to be washed out for the point cloud results presented in this paper.  \n\nI would like to see comparison experiments with voxel based approaches in the next update for the paper.  \n\n[1]\n@article{tatarchenko2017octree,\n  title={Octree Generating Networks: Efficient Convolutional Architectures for High-resolution 3D Outputs},\n  author={Tatarchenko, Maxim and Dosovitskiy, Alexey and Brox, Thomas},\n  journal={arXiv preprint arXiv:1703.09438},\n  year={2017}\n}\n\nIn light of the authors' octree updates score is updated.  I expect these updates to be reflected in the final version of the paper itself as well. [[CLA-POS],[JUS-POS],[DEP-POS],[FAI-NEU],[CON-NEU],[ENG-NEU],[ACC-NEU],[CST-NEU],[NOV-NEU],[ETH-NEU]]
